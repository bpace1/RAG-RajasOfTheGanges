That’s right I am onceagain bringing you the latest hotness, just six years too late! Designed by Inka andMarkus Brand, a duo perhaps better known for their Exit: The Game range. As regular readers of my reviews know, I quite often pair board games to music, like a sommelier pairing wine to menu dishes. Before I even reach for Rajas of the Gangesfrom the shelf, Kula Shaker’s Govinda is playing in my head. You’re here for a review nota music lesson… so on with the mixtape, I mean review… ©boardgamereview.co.uk TLDR: click for final thoughts and scores Setup There is a board to spread out centrally between all players. Sort the province tiles by their colour and then again by their animal backs, flip them over so you have twelvestacks of face up tiles.

They will then need to place their relevant pieces on the board. Add theyield tokens onto the board too. Each player then takes one of each colour dice and rollsthem, placing them on Kali. There are some mini expansions or game variants included in the box and set up can differ slightly when playing with those. There is a bit to sort out at the start of the game, but it doesn’t take long. ©boardgamereview.co.uk Gameplay In its simplest form Rajas of the Ganges is a race for points. A player will win the game if their wealth track which moves anti-clockwise crosses their fame track which movesclockwise, around the edge of the board. Although you will place workers on the board, most spaces cost a specific die to visit.The board is divided into different areas. The Chambers with the characters on, give different benefits depending on what dice you use. These vary from claiming the first player token, to gaining more dice, yield token bonuses or karma points.

The Palace below allows you to convert, gain or reroll dice. The Quarry allows you to purchase a tile with specific coloured dice matching the cost on the tile. These are then placed on yourProvince board gaining fame and/or wealth. Once you have placed some tiles, theMarket Place might be beneficial to sell wares matching the symbols on your tiles formoney. Finally, the harbour allows to move up the river and grants handy one-offbonuses where your ship stops. Also on the board is a karma tracker, you can spend these to flip a die to its opposite side and tracks to increase the fame of constructing different buildings when you placetiles into your province with matching symbols. You will also unlock additional workers throughout the game which help ramp up the game time. ©boardgamereview.co.uk Variants I have mostly played the vanilla version of Rajas of the Ganges, but I have tried the so-called Navaratnas version to mix it up. It changes things like the number of dice you canstore, or upgrade the yield tokens to ones you can choose.

Whereas, the Ganga Module modifies the spaces on the river. There is also a variant that can help handicap more seasoned players againstnewcomers to the game. ©boardgamereview.co.uk What it’s like While you can and will spend wealth, dice are the most important resource of the game.Most spaces on the board will see you profiting from one die maximum. Although thegame tricks you into thinking you get two dice from some spaces, you will have paid adie to activate that space. Dice are important because you will need them for almostevery square on the board or to build tiles on your personal Province board. With tilesoften costing a couple of dice, the challenge of keeping your dice supply high is tricky. What I have always admired in Rajas of the Ganges is how beautifully balanced the pip values are. Throughout the course of the game you will find yourself ebbing and flowingbetween wanting higher and lower value dice. Generally the board is better with lowerpip values, but the better building tiles tend to be a higher cost and thus higher rolls arebeneficial. Of course rolling dice does add an element of luck. There are times you arehoping to see a certain roll and may or may not see it. More often than not however,there are ways to utilise most rolls, they just may not be as optimum as you would like. The worker placement is tight too, with many areas having just one space. Competition for these can be high, and you will find yourself looking at what dice the other playershave before deciding where your attention should focus. Stealing the first player tokencan be more advantageous than in some other games.

As more meeplesget unlocked the game speeds up and it becomes a nail biting race for fame and wealth.This can take players by surprise if they are not used to the fast pace. It is very temptingto blissfully build a beautiful network on your Province boards. This is important, but atsome point you have to look at how you can make that last minute dash to cross the line.In many two player games, the defeated opponent would be left saying the immortalwords ‘if I just had one more turn…’ which highlights the importance of making everymove count. There is a lot to take in and learn, but it clicks quite quickly. I often find the Market area the trickiest to translate, but I’ve played it enough to articulate it now. ©boardgamereview.co.uk We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

It is a bombardment on the visual senses and a little daunting. I like it now and it all makes sense, but I remember when I first sawit, I was like… woah that’s a lot! Bearing in mind it was released in 2017, for me thestyling feels more dated than that. I almost feel like I shouldn’t like it as much as I do! The wooden components are all fine, as is the cardboard first player token. The tiles for the province board match the overall artwork nicely. I really like the backs of these tilesand I sometimes wish this palette was used more throughout the game. The dice are satisfyingly chunky without being over the top. They are good translucent colours too. I’m a big fan of these D6s. When you are done playing, it all packs away nicely in the plastic insert. ©boardgamereview.co.uk Rulebook There is a little ambiguity around the ‘Master Builder’ action whereby you can overlay a tile on top of a previously laid one. In the English rules it states you do not get the yieldbonuses again, suggesting if it hadn’t been previously activated you would get thebonus. The German rules state: “Du erhältst beim Überbauen nie Sondererträge” whichtranslates as “You never receive special yields when overbuilding” which seems moreexplicit. Bearing in mind it was a German game from a German publisher, that’s how Iplay it. I rarely use the Master Builder anyway! Otherwise the rulebook is pretty good, albeit just as busy as the board!

I haven’t compared and contrasted all the English and German text, so maybe there are other parts I’m playing wrong. Perhaps I should caveat that this is a review of the Englishrulebook version! ©boardgamereview.co.uk Final thoughts on Rajas of the Ganges There are some games that I will never part with and that I will always jump at theopportunity to play. Rajas of the Ganges is one of those games. I adore the workerplacement and race to trigger the end of the game. While you may feel like you are in aPaula Abdul song, permanently taking two steps forward and then one step back,progress is made and the game ramps up in a really good way as the finish line drawsin. Dice in games can be a put-off for many, but there is enough options to compensate for not getting ideal rolls. They might still frustrate and force you to adapt to secondaryoptions, the nice thing is this board game gives plenty of ways to utilise your rolls andslightly mitigate them. The worker placement can be equally frustrating when someonesteals the spot you were about to claim. For me, this adds to the strategy of the game, rather than deter me from enjoying it.

              "'India in the era of the aspiring Mogul empire. New lands are being gained along with great prosperity attained through the trading of silk, tea, and  spices. Imposing structures such as the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort are built, and gorgeous gardens are created alongside new buildings and parks  that will impress generations to come even centuries later. At a time when the empire has almost reached its greatest dimensions and is in a phase of relative stability, players, representing rajas and ranis,  are called upon to live up to the requirements of their role as venerable sovereigns. They must improve their estates into magnificent and wealthy  provinces. Keeping in mind the important role of karma, players balance their growth in a demanding interplay of prestige and prosperity. The one  with the most successful outcome will truly become one of the nation’s legendary leaders. For 2 to 4 players, 12 years and up Contents  Object of the Game Your task is to develop your province with the help of your workers and the clever use  of your accumulated dice. In the end, you must win the race with a combination of wealth and fame. The fame track and the money track run parallel to each other in opposite directions around the gameboard. The fame markers are moved clockwise, the money markers, counter-clockwise. As you build and expand, you attempt to increase both your fame and wealth so that  your fame marker and your money marker intersect. The first player to have his fame marker and his money marker converge or even pass each other on their tracks, has a good chance to win. 4 bonus markers1 (double-sided)  gameboard (2 players or 3 and 4 players)4 “Kali statue” boards 4 province boards 24 workers (6 per color) 4 fame markers  (1 per color)4 money markers  (1 per color)48 dice   (12 per color) 1 starting player elephant (to be put together before the first game)20 cubes   (5 per color: 4x upgrade  and 1x karma)64 province tiles   (16 per color) 30 yield tiles  (8 in white, 9 in yellow, 6 in red, 7 in brown)2 cover tiles (for the 3-player game) 8 river tiles 4 boats  (1 per color) fame track money track Set-up The player who has rolled the lowest total  value becomes the starting player. In case of a tie,  it’s the player who ate Indian food last. He  places the starting player elephant  by his Kali statue and puts his money  marker on space 3 of the money track.  The player to his left (i.e., in player order) puts  his money marker on space 4, the player to  the left of that player puts his on space 5,  and so on; consequently, the player to go last  in the first round starts with the most money.Place the gameboard in the middle of the table with the side that corresponds to the number of players facing up ( “2 players“  or “3 and 4  players“ ). In a 3-player game,  cover the marked spaces with the cover tiles: Put all 48 dice next to the game-board as a general supply. Not needed: the yellow, red, and brown yield tiles (you use them only for the Navaratnas version) and the 8 river tiles (for the Ganga-Module). Sort the province tiles, first by colors  and then by the symbol on their backs (snake, cow, tiger) so that you get  12 stacks. Mix the 12 stacks separately and put them face up next to the gameboard, well visible to everybody.Mix the 8 white yield tiles and put them as a face-down stack on the temple.  Each player gets a province  board and the players components in one color: one  Kali statue board, 6 workers, 1 boat, 5 cubes (karma and upgrade), 1 money marker and 1 fame marker, plus 1 bonus marker for the money track.  Put the Kali statue  and the province board with the depicted sides facing up in front  of you.  Place 3 of your workers below your Kali statue.Place 3 workers on the appli-cable spaces on the record tracks (fame: 15, money: 20) and on the river (bridge). Put your boat on the starting space of the river. Place your karma cube on level 1 of the karma path. Put 1 upgrade cube  in the left column  (value 2) of each  “Building  development“ scroll. Put your fame marker on space 0 of the fame track.Put your bonus marker for   the money track with the river  space side up on the first bonus space of the money track (space 12).Each player  takes one die in each color, rolls these 4 dice, and puts them, with the rolled result facing up, on any unoccupied arms of  his Kali statue. Course of the Game The game proceeds over several rounds, each of which consists of several  stages. In each stage, players, in turn – in clockwise order, beginning with the starting player – place one worker, pay the costs, if required, and immediately carry out the associated action. This continues until nobody can place a worker any more. After that, each player takes his workers back, and a new round begins. Workers can be placed in the following areas on the gameboard: I.  At the quarry, in order to carry out building actions on your  province board. II.  At the market place, in order to receive money through market scorings later in the game. III. In the Great Mogul’s palace, in order to get various benefits there. IV.  At the harbor, in order to advance on the river and thus reach lucrative river spaces. At the quarry and at the harbor, workers are always placed row by row from left to right. At the market place and in the palace, you can choose any (unoccupied) action space. While advancing on the fame and money tracks and developing your province  board, you will have chances to obtain valuable bonuses. Placing workers and carrying out the associated actions The placement of workers always proceeds in this order: 1. Place a worker 2. Pay costs, if required: give up money and/or dice3. Carry out the action Costs: Depending on what action space you place a worker on, you might have  to pay costs for being allowed to carry out the applicable action. Some spaces are for free; for others, you have to give up dice or money. How much it costs to place a worker on an action space is shown on the action space itself.  On each action space there may be only one worker. Dice are never placed  onto the board, but always into the (general or personal) supply!Pay money for an action: Every time you have to pay money for an action (e.g., at the harbor or the quarry), you move your money marker back on the money track accordingly – 1 space for each money you have to pay. If your marker is sitting on 0, you have no money left and temporarily cannot carry out any actions that cost money. The same applies to actions for which you have to pay dice – if you  don’t have any (suitable) dice, you can’t carry out the applicable action. Dice are the most important resource in this game. Whenever you get a die from the general supply, you roll it immediately and, with the rolled number facing up, add it to your own supply, i.e., on your Kali statue. The value of the die conforms to the number rolled (from 1 to 6). Attention! You may store only as many dice as Kali has free hands – that means, in the basic game you may own a maximum of 10 dice. If you get into a situation that would get you more dice, you either take fewer dice or put dice from your Kali statue back into the general supply before taking new ones. If a die color is temporarily unavailable  in the supply, you can’t take this color at that moment. cost-free 1 money 1 die of the   applicable color quarry market place harbor palace Building action (quarry)   Place a province tile in your province and get fame  points and/or money for this In order to develop your province, you need to send workers into the quarry. Depending on the space where you place the worker, you pay 1 to 4 money on the money track. In return, you acquire one of the 12 province tiles on open display. On the top left of the tiles you can see what dice with which total minimum value you have to give up in order to take the tile. Put dice of the respective color back into the supply. Their total value has to be at least as high as the one shown on the tile. When building, you are allowed to overpay. That means: In order to acquire a tile with the value “blue 7,“ you can pay with a blue 3 and a blue 5, for example. Besides the costs, the tiles also depict roads, buildings and/or markets. Once you  acquire a province tile, you immediately have to place it onto your province board. Example: Rajesh sends one of his workers into the quarry. He pays 1 money. Then he puts  2 orange dice back into the supply. He takes the tile with the orange 9  and connects it to  an already-existing road on his province board. The province boards The province board shows the  territory that you, being a raja, control and strive to expand. Your residence is in the middle on the top; from there, 3 roads lead into the country. Every time you add a new province tile, the end of one of its roads has to connect to an  already-existing road, so that there is a connection to the residence. You can turn the new tile in any direction. You may also orient a tile in such a way that it cuts off a road of an adjacent tile; not all road ends need to be connected – it is sufficient that each tile is connected to the residence through at least one road. Once placed, the tiles cannot be relocated later on. Be careful not to cut off all roads, so that you always have good possibilities for placing a tile.Special yields – There are yields printed on the edge of the province boards (symbolically, for special gains due to trade relations you have established). You get these immediately when you have connected them to your residence via a road, after scoring for the province tile itself (see below). Example:  Leila  puts  a province tile with  a bend in the corner on the left. Since the ends of the road on the tile connect to both adjacent yields and are thus connected to the residence, Leila  is  allowed to take any 1 die from the supply and advance her money marker 5 spaces. Of course, it is also possible to place a tile without creating a connection to  the special yield. In this case, you don’t get anything extra. When you have added a new tile to your province, you immediately score  money and/or fame for it. Some tiles show one or two market tents with certain goods (silk, tea, or spices) of a certain value; other tiles show one or two buildings (temple, palace, fort, or mill); and a few tiles show a combination of both. When you add a tile with one or two markets to your province, you immediately receive the amount of money indicated on that tile. When   you add a tile with one or two buildings, you immediately receive 2, 3,   or 4 fame points for each building, depending on where your upgrade   cube is on the scroll for the corresponding building on the gameboard.  The upgades of the buildings The 4 types of buildings that you   can erect in your province are shown  on the gameboard. At the beginning  of the game, your upgrade cubes lie  on the first level of each building –  i.e., you earn 2 fame points when you  add a province tile with 1 building (or, likewise, 4 fame points for 2 buildings).   Upgrades enable you to improve  your constructional skills and to earn  3 (or 4) points for a certain building  type in later building actions. You can acquire upgrades from the raja at the  palace by giving up a value-4 die there (see p.  18,  “The Chambers“). In addition, there is a river space that allows you an upgrade. And you may upgrade a building automatically after you have crossed the applicable bonus space (space 5) on the fame track or connect the applicable special yield on your province board. When you are allowed to upgrade, you choose one of the four building types and move your upgrade cube one space to the right in the corresponding row. Attention! Upgrades don’t count for buildings on  tiles that are already lying in your province, but only for buildings that you add after upgrading.  Example: There are 2 buildings on the bend that Leila  has added. She advances  her fame marker 5 spaces, since she earns 2 points for the temple plus 3 points for the mill – which she already upgraded once in an earlier turn.  Since she has connected a special yield to the road network and the residence  by placing the tile, she may – after scoring for the tile – take another die of any  color and upgrade a building of her choice.Market action (market place)   Collect money for certain markets in your province Every time you send a worker to one  of the market spaces, you generate income for the markets laid out in   your province. There are markets with   3 kinds of goods:  silk             tea          spices  and 2 types of market spaces: Assorted goods – when you place a worker here, you  may score for exactly one market per kind of good. Example:   There are 4 markets on display in Rajesh’s  province – three of them with tea and one  with silk. If he places one of his workers on this market space, he can score for   2 markets: the silk market plus one of the 3 tea markets. For this, he gets 5 money. Goods of one kind – when you place a worker here, you have to give up any one die. Then you may score for up to a maximum of as many markets of one kind of good as corresponds to the value of the die.   Example: If Rajesh  places his worker on this market space and gives up a die with a value  of 4, he can score for all 3 tea markets and gets 7 money for this. Attention! In the 3- or 4-player game, you may place only one of your workers on the assorted goods market in a round; that means, if you have placed a worker on the first space, the second space is no longer available to you in this round. It can then only be used by another player. However, you still have the possibility to place workers on the other market type. II. upgrade symbol Actions at the palace Give up a die, if required, and get a benefit When you place a worker in the Great Mogul’s palace, this can be without   cost or may require giving up one die – a die of either a specific color or an exact number. The palace has the following areas:  The outer terrace (cost: free) Take 2 money. You may also reroll as many  of your dice as you want. The terrace   (cost: free) Take 1 die of the  applicable color from the supply. Example:  Leila takes one orange die from the supply,  rolls it and puts it on her Kali statue.  The balconies (cost: 1 die of a specific color) Give up 1 die of a specific color  and get 2 dice of a different color.  Example:  Rajesh gives up one blue die (of any value) and  takes 2 orange dice; he rolls them immediately and  puts them on his Kali statue.   The chambers (cost: 1 die of any color with an exact number) Great Mogul – Give up one die showing a “1.“ In return,  you get 2 fame points and become the starting player in the next round.  Dancer – Give up one die showing a “2.“ In return, you take  any 2 dice from the supply and draw a face-down white yield tile. You immediately earn the yield of the tile (1 die, 3 money, 1 upgrade, or 1 karma). Then the yield tile is put aside to form a discard pile. When you run out of tiles, reshuffle the used ones and form a new supply.  Yogi – Give up one die showing a “3.” In return, you get   2 karma and 1 die of your choice (see p.  20, explanations of   the karma).  Raja Man Singh – Give up  one die showing a “4.” In return, you upgrade a building type of your choice and earn  3 money. Master builder – Give up one die showing a “5.” Cover any  tile in your province with another one from the supply. All tiles still need to have a connection to the residence. You cannot use the master builder if you have no matching tiles or dice. Important: The new tile has to be more expensive than the  old one; just pay the difference by giving up 1 (or more) dice in the color of the new tile. You may overpay.  Example: Leila  gives up a green value-5 die. She  wants to overbuild the tile with the orange “ 4”  by covering it with the tile with the violet “6.”  To  do so, she has to give up a violet die with a value  of at least 2. When covering a tile, you do not receive any special yield  again. You may cover every province tile only once.   Portuguese – Give up one die showing a “6.” In return, you  advance exactly 6 unoccupied spaces on the river and get the applicable earnings. Attention! When you have advanced to the last 6 spaces on  the river, you may not use the Portuguese anymore. III. River action (harbor)   Give up a die showing a 1, 2, or 3 and advance up to three  unoccupied spaces on the river The river action can be used only if you give up a “1,” “2,” or “3.”  Every time you place a worker at the harbor, you may advance your boat up to three unoccupied spaces on the river, depending on the number on the die you have given up. The harbor provides space for several workers. The first worker placed here doesn’t cost anything; workers placed later cost 1 or 2 money.  If you give up a die showing a “1,” you advance exactly one unoccupied space; if you give up a “2,” you advance one or two unoccupied spaces; if you give up a “3,” you may advance up to three unoccupied spaces. Spaces occupied by other players’ boats are not included in the count but are skipped. So there can never be more than one boat on any particular river space.The only exceptions to this are the starting space and the final river space where multiple boats may rest. You immediately get the earnings of the space where you stop your boat. Example: Leila  places a  worker at the harbor. For  this, she has to pay 1 money. Then she gives up a die showing a “2” and advances her boat 2 spaces. She doesn’t include the space that is occupied by another player’s yellow boat in the count. She earns an upgrade of one building type. She moves her  upgrade cube at the mill from “3” to “ 4.” Explanation of the earnings on the river:  Take 2 dice of any colors from the supply, roll them, and  put them on your Kali statue. Increase your karma 2 levels (see p.  20, explanations of  the karma). Receive the amount of money indicated; advance  accordingly on the money track.Choose any of the palace actions 2 - 6 (Dancer, Yogi, Raja, Master builder or Portuguese) and carry it out immediately without placing a worker in the palace or giving up a die   (the space in the palace may even be occupied). For each level of karma that you have at this moment, take  one die in the depicted color (so receive 0 to 3 dice).  Receive the number of fame points indicated; advance  accordingly on the fame track. Upgrade a building type 1 level (e.g., move your temple  cube from 2 to 3).  Receive 1 money for each market that you have built in your  province so far (if you have 5 markets, for example, you advance your money marker 5 spaces on the money track). Conduct a market scoring for up to a maximum of markets  of  assorted goods. Collect the money for up to 3 different markets (see p.  17, explanation of the markets). Conduct a market scoring for goods of one kind that you have in your province, up to the maximum indicated on the river.  If you have 4 silk markets, for example, you can score for all of them and advance on the money track accordingly. You do not have to give up a die for this (see p. 17, explanation of the markets).  Receive 1 fame point per building upgrade that you have  done up to now (if you have already upgraded buildings 3 times, for example, you advance 3 spaces on the fame track). Receive 2 money per building upgrade that you have done  up to now (if you have already upgraded buildings 3 times, for example, you advance 6 spaces on the money track). Receive 2 fame points per karma that you have at the moment (if your karma is at level 2, for example, you advance 4 spaces on the fame track). When you have arrived at the final river space, you can no longer use the river action. IV. Karma   Give up 1 karma and turn a die to the number on the opposite side You can influence the result of a die roll through karma. One karma allows you  to turn any die on your Kali statue to the opposite side when you place it;  that means a “1” can turn into a “6” and vice versa, a “2” into a “5,” etc. You start the game with karma at level 1. Over the course of the game, you can improve your karma – for instance, by sending a worker to the Yogi in the palace (see p.  18,  “The Chambers”   “Yogi”) or by  stopping your boat on the applicable river space (see p.  19, “River action”). Besides this, there is a bonus space on the fame track (space 24) that increases your karma 2 levels if your fame marker stops on that space or crosses it. The highest karma level is 3; that means you may have a maximum of 3 karma. In order to use karma, you don’t have to place any worker – you may use  your karma anytime during your turn when giving up a die. For each karma you use, you move your karma cube 1 level down. So the karma can even go down to zero. Get new workers Move forward on the scoring tracks or on the river and receive more workers At the beginning of the game, each player has 3 active workers at his disposal. During the course of the game, you can get up to 2 additional  workers. If you have advanced far enough on the respective scoring tracks (money: space 20; fame: space 15) or on the river (bridge), you receive extra workers.  Important: As soon as you have received your second inactive worker (no matter whether on one of the tracks or the river), you immediately take your extra one off the board and remove him from the game.   The fame and the money tracks as well as the river each have one space with an inactive worker per player color. The spaces on the scoring tracks with the inactive workers are regular spaces; at the moment when your money marker or fame marker stops on the respective space or crosses it, you take the worker of your color. With this, he becomes active. The inactive worker on the river doesn’t have his own river space (the bridge doesn’t count as a river space); that means, when your boat has passed the bridge, you take the worker of your color.You never lose a worker once you have activated him this way, even if your marker falls back (which can happen only on the money track). You can place a new worker even in the same round in which you have obtained him. Bonuses on the scoring tracks Arrive at the space and receive the bonus Besides the inactive workers, the two scoring tracks also have special spaces;  when you reach or cross them, you immediately get the corresponding bonus. The fame track has 3 bonus spaces: Space 5: You receive an upgrade of a building type of your  choice. (This upgrade counts from your next turn on.) Space 24: You may increase your karma 2 levels. Space 31: You may move your boat to the next unoccupied  river space and get the applicable earnings. The money track has 4 bonus spaces: Spaces 12 and 44: You may move your boat to the next unoccupied river space and get the applicable earnings. Spaces 33 and 55: You may take any 2 dice from the supply,   roll them, and put them on your Kali statue. Since you pay money and can thus fall back on the money track,  there is a special bonus marker of your color that indicates which bonus you’ll get next on the money track. When you reach or cross space 12 for the first time and get the applicable bonus, you take the marker of your color, turn it over and put it on space 33 (die side facing up). When your money marker reaches or crosses this space as well, you turn the marker back and put it on space 44 (river space side facing up), etc. After you have crossed the last bonus space on the money track, you remove your marker from the game. Attention! A bonus applies only to the track where it is printed. If, for example, your money marker passes a bonus space printed on the adjoining fame track, you don’t get the bonus from there, of course. After you have placed all of your active workers and carried  out the applicable actions, the round ends. If one of the players has placed a worker at the Great Mogul, he now gets the starting player elephant and becomes the starting player  End of a Round End of the Game Notesof the following round. If nobody has sent a worker to the Great Mogul, the elephant goes from the previous starting player clockwise to the next player. All players take all their active workers off the gameboard and put them back below their Kali statue. After that, the starting player begins the new round. As soon as one player manages to have his fame marker and his money marker converge or pass each other, the end of the game is triggered. The current stage will still be completed – i.e., all players who are sitting between the player who has triggered the end of the game and the current starting player still have a chance to win and may place one more worker (provided they have any left) and carry out the applicable action. In order to develop your province successfully and to win the race, you primarily need money, dice, and workers. It is important to make sure that you don’t run out of dice or of money and don’t have to make do with fewer workers than the other players for too long. To summarize in brief: Gain additional workers by advancing on the two scoring tracks and on the river. Generate money primarily through markets; build them in your province and  use workers to activate them. Additionally, bonuses on your province board, After that, players check who has won. If there are two or more players whose markers passed each other on their final turn, each of the players involved counts the difference of fame points between his money marker and his fame marker; the player with the most points wins the game. In case of a tie, the first player whose two markers passed each other wins. (To find out who is second and third, etc., count the number of fame points  that are still separating your fame marker from your money marker.) on the river, and from the raja in the palace are good sources of money. Such bonus spaces can get you extra dice as well. The palace also provides  opportunities to obtain and exchange individual dice. To fulfill the winning conditions, you need to establish a well thought-out road  network within your province and gain as many special yields as possible. To this end, you will use the building action on the gameboard, for which you pay money and dice. Buildings in your province give you fame points; markets give you money. Example: Rajesh’s  money marker has passed his fame marker. His money marker is now on space 65 of the money track, his fame marker on space 30  of the fame track. Then Leila  has her final turn. She also manages to have her two markers pass each other. Her money marker ends up on space 52 of  the money track, her fame marker on space 37 of the fame track. So Rajesh  and Leila  both have a difference of 2 fame points (it doesn’t matter where  the money marker is). Since Rajesh  was the first to have his two markers pass each other, he ekes out the win. Play with 6 workers, 8 dice, and upgraded special yields After having played the basic version for one or more games, you can opt  for the “Navaratnas“ version for advanced players (English “The Nine Gems“, see p. 24, Mogul Lexicon   Raja Man Singh I). Here, the following  modifications apply: You can activate all 3 inactive workers.  So you may play with up to 6 workers.  You play with the back of your Kali statue   and you may store only up to 8 dice.  You play on the back of your province board.  Here also, special yields are printed on the edge of the province board, which you can connect to your road network. However, these are only minor yields, but you can improve them during the course of the game. At the beginning of the game, mix the brown yield  tiles. Each player randomly picks one, reveals it and puts it on one of the two possible spaces on his province board. You decide which of the special yields on the board you wish to cover.   At the moment when you connect them, the brown yield tiles give you a special yield that depends on the progress you have made so far in a specific field:  Now place the remaining brown yield tiles as well as all other yield tiles face up on the buildings of the same color on the gameboard. You may get them during the game to enhance the special yield you can get from your province board. The white, yellow, and red yield tiles give   you special yields as follows: Attention! Always score for the province tile first before you take the special  yield. You may not move or cover yield tiles already placed on the board. There are 2 ways to obtain additional yield tiles during the game: a) When you are at the dancer Every time you place a worker at the dancer and give up one value-2  die of any color, you may take 2 dice of your choice from the supply and choose any yield tile. You immediately put this tile face up on an (as yet) unoccupied space of the corresponding color on your province board. Different from the basic game, here you earn the yield not immediately but only when you have connected the yield tile to a road on your province board. b) When you have fewer active workers than other players If, for example, you have a total of 4 active workers, but at least one of  the other players already has 5 workers at his disposal, you get 1 yield tile in the fifth stage of the current round if it were your turn to place a worker but you don’t have any left. You immediately decide on which unoccupied space of your board you want to place the new yield tile (face up and  color-matching). Navaratnas  Version Dice (1 or 2 of  specific colors or  of your choice)Money Karma (1 or 2)1 building upgrade 1 boat move (onto  the next unoccupied  river space) 1 fame point for each tile  in your province that has  at least 1 market 2 fame points for  each bend that  you have built in  your province1 money per building  in your province 2 money for each  yield tile you   have connected1 fame point  for each active  worker you have1 fame point for every  3 river spaces you  have advanced so far  (the starting space  doesn’t count) 2 money per  upgrade you have  made so far The river tiles: Take as many dice of any colors from the supply as you  have karma at this moment (e.g., 3 dice of the same color or of different colors, if your karma is at level 3).  Take 3 dice, one of each color shown.  Take the palace action, depending on the character shown (see page 18, The “Chambers“). Conduct a market scoring for goods of one kind. Collect the money for up to 3 markets of one type in your province, for which you do not have to pay an extra die (see p.  17, explanation of the markets). Advance up to 3 unoccupied spaces on the river and collect the earnings of the space where you stop.If at least one other player even has 2 more active workers than you, you take another yield tile and place it as if it were your turn to place a worker but you can’t place any for the second time.  Attention! You may only take yield tiles in a color for which you still have  space available on your board. You may also refrain from taking a yield tile. For Mixed Player Groups For advanced players who play with a group that includes beginners, it is also possible to play with handicaps.  In this case, the advanced players use the Navaratnas side             of theirboard and the back of their Kali statue, whereas the beginners use the basicside            of their board and the front of their Kali statue. You can have up to 5 workers. The yellow, red, and brown yield tiles stay in the  box. You play according to the basic rules and use only the white yield tiles for which you get a yield only at the dancer (as in the basic game) to  use immediately. Modify river spaces using river tiles For this version, you add the 8 river tiles to the game. They modify the river earnings. At the beginning of the game, shuffle the river tiles face down. Roll a die, count the spaces, beginning with the first space after the starting space, draw the first tile blindly and place it face up on the corresponding river space. For example, if you roll a “2,“ you place the first river tile on the second space and, in doing so, replace the 2 karma shown there.   Roll again, count the next spaces and place a tile until either you run out of  tiles or the river ends. The final space may never be covered by a river tile. Return remaining river tiles to the game box. The Ganga Module Mogul empire (1526-1858) – The Mogul empire was  a great empire that developed in the Indus-Ganges plain in North India. At the peak of its power (17 century), it comprised almost the entire India (as we know it today) and some parts of Afghanistan. In 1858, the remaining part of the empire was occupied  by the British and ceased to exist. A rich heritage of architecture, painting, and poetry shaped by Persian and Indian artists have been preserved to the present day. The empire was named after its rulers, the Great Moguls. Great Mogul – Also called ’Mogul’ or ’Mogul Emperor.’ The name probably came to Europe through  the Portuguese (in Portuguese,  Grão Mogol ) who were  the dominating power in the Indian Ocean territory at  that time. The word Mogul is derived from the Persian  mughul , which means ’Mongol,’ referring to the fact  that some Mogul’s ancestor had married into the clan of Genghis Khan. The most prominent Mogul ruler in history was Akbar the Great (reign:  1556-1605); he brought the empire to prosperity in military, political, and economic terms. Under Shah Jahan (reign: 1627-1658), the Mogul empire reached its cultural peak. At that time, the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort (Delhi), and the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore were established – all of them inscribed as UNESCO world heritage sites (in 1982, 2007, and 1981). This game symbolically deals with the era from Akbar to Shah Jahan. These are a few elements significant for the era of the Great Moguls or for the  India of today that are showcased in the game: Kali – A Hindu goddess that represents destruction  and renewal. Her destructive power, however, mainly targets demons and the injustice of the world. Popular belief is that she can grant wishes.(Blue) Peafowl – Since 1963, the blue peafowl has officially been ranked among the national animals of India (besides the Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin). Originally, it came from the Indian subcontinent where it is considered a sacred animal since it gives warning of tigers and severe weather  and kills (young) poisonous snakes, among other things. Whereas the western world often associates the peafowl not only with beauty but also with arrogance and vanity, Indians primarily consider it a symbol of regality and immortality. Therefore, peacock statues were prominently designed also on the throne of the Mogul emperors. Peacock Throne – The Peacock Throne was a throne chair decorated with an abundance of pearls, gold, and gems (more than 26,000) that was manufactured by order of Shah Jahan and inaugurated in 1635. The production took seven years and was said to  have been twice as expensive as the construction of the Taj Mahal; this was considered very extravagant even for a Mogul emperor. Since the Red Fort (Delhi) was plundered in the 18 th century, the Peacock Throne has been  presumed lost. Ashoka Pillar – The present coat of arms of India shows the adapted capital of an Ashoka pillar, the famous “Four Lions of Sarnath.” Erected around 250 BC under Ashoka, the Indian ruler at that time, who had numerous monumental pillars set up during his  reign at many strategic places, such as border towns and trade routes. Their capitals were used to proclaim his edicts. Some of these then-numerous and widespread pillars have been preserved down to the present day. They are silent witnesses of the bygone Great Indian Empire whose cultural heritage has stood the test of time. Raja Man Singh I – Raja Man Singh I was an important commander of the imperial armed forces. As a governor of several provinces, he had forest areas cultivated for agricultural progress, commissioned a variety of palaces, forts, and temples to be built, and  was even engaged as a city founder. Additionally, Man Singh I gained a high reputation for being a member of the Navaratnas, the “Nine Gems” of Akbar, a small group of extraordinary personalities at the Mogul emperor’s court.

              "\"hi everyone my name is modi and i'm naveen from before you play and today we are going to be doing a playthrough of rogers of the ganges now this is a game that was requested by one of our longtime patreon supporters an executive producer so thank you so much for that this one's designed by two different designers inca and marcus brand and it is published by r r games and hooch and it is a two to four player very euro style game and so we are pretty excited to showcase it today it's interesting because it is definitely a heroes style game but there is some dice rolling there is yup there's quite a bit of dice rolling and so in this game we're going to be building up our province uh in india we're trying to earn a lot of money and fame at the same time and as per usual we are going to start with an overview of how the game is played then we're going to go into our playthrough and then our review of it and so if you're interested in jumping around we will include time stamps down below last but not least if you'd like to see more videos like this in the future please consider subscribing and with that we are ready to begin so if you please direct your attention to the center of the table we're all set up here for our two-player game of rogers of the ganges now we are playing with the two player side of the board the the board is reversible to scale for player count we each also have our own province boards now in this game the primary mechanism here is we're going to be taking these tiles and we're going to be laying them out onto our province board to build out our estate and so the whole purpose of that is so that we can earn money and fame because the whole premise of this game is it is kind of like a dual-sided uh score track along the edge of the the board over here is the money track and so there is no physical money in this game whenever we spend and earn money we just progress our marker along this track on the opposite side of the board starts the fame track and that is kind of like this golden fan side here and so over the course of the game whenever we earn fame we're going to progress along this track and so as soon as one person's markers kind of intersect and converge that is going to signal the end of the game you're going to finish out that turn and then at that point whoever's marker is intersected the furthest is the winner yeah you want a delicate balance between money and fame in this game yeah so you heard that right there are no technical points in this game it's just whoever can get those markers to intersect past each other will win the game at the start of the game each player starts with one of each color of dice and there are four different colors of dice anytime you acquire dyson in the game you roll it immediately and then you place it on your kali statue and so we're going to be playing the the standard uh mode of play because there's technically two different modes and so with this motor player we use this side of the province board as well as this side of the cauli statue so you can only hold a maximum of 10 dice and each player also starts with three workers the way that a round works is players are going to be taking turns placing their workers out onto the board because it's technically a work replacement game and so once everybody has placed on all of their workers then the round will end and you pretty much continue doing this until the end game has been met the board is divided into different sections and each section can do a specific thing and so there's the quarry over here the market the harbor which pertains to this river and then the palace and so let's just start with the quarry to discuss uh you know the different things that you can do each section has different work replacement spots and only one person's workers can go there at any given time and so some spots don't require you to pay anything and they'll be empty just like this some spots require you to turn in specific colors of dice or specific values of dice and some spots require you to pay money and so starting with a quarry over here this section allows you to build province tiles onto your province board you have to pay a little bit of money so the first person to go there has to pay one money and you would just spend it on your money track here if you do this several times in a round then it kind of increases in the amount of money you have to pay but basically if i want to take this action i would place a worker there spend my money and then i get to place one of these tiles onto my profits board now the way that you read a tile here is as you can see each tile has a certain color at the top left-hand corner with a value and then it'll either show a certain combination of markets that give you money or temples just like this one that give you fame and there are four different temples in the game which we'll talk about in a second but in order to uh purchase one of these tiles you have to spend dice from your cauli statue that add up to at least that value so if i were to take this tile i would have to spend blue dice that add up to at least a five i can overpay you just don't get changed and so i would turn in those dice into the supply and i would place this tile onto my profits board and so the rules are you must be able to connect your tile directly back to your own palace so i wouldn't be able to just place it out into the center here because i have to be able to connect you can have your roads get cut off as long as you can continually draw a path back to your main palace some other things that you might see on the board are some of these special bonuses along the edge if you can ever connect your path so that it connects to one of these special yields then you get that bonus immediately and so some things that you might see are like additional money so that would get me three money or a die from the supply of whatever color of your choosing you would just roll it right away put it under cauli statue sometimes you'll get fame and if you can ever connect to this middle area here there's also a space that gets you an upgrade for one of these temples which we'll talk about and so after you place your tile you also get the benefits of the tile itself and so if you have markets that give you money then you get that much money immediately on your score track if you place a tile that has a temple on it then you get as much fame as wherever your cube is on that specific temple and so this tile shows two different temples it shows this one and this one and so if i were to place this tile on my board i would get two fame for this one because that's where my my cube is and two fame for this for a total of four fame now some bonuses throughout the game will allow you to do an upgrade which is kind of like that symbol that shows like a sideways arrow you'll see it right there as well and so anytime you see that bonus you get to choose one of these temples to move your marker up a space essentially increasing the value of that temple for any future placements of those tiles exactly yeah and so that is where a majority of the game is going to be taking place everything else that we're going to explain is just kind of how you can do that better right because you you need a steady flow of dice you know that is one of your main currencies in this game as you'll see the next section of the board is the markets and so the markets allow you to uh collect income for markets you've already placed on the board temples once you've placed donuts they essentially don't do anything more for you they're one time only but markets you can continue to reap the benefits of throughout the game let's start with this spot over here because it's free as you can see if i were to place my worker here i can collect money from one of each type of market that i have on my board exactly there are three different types of markets in the game there is spice oops spice silk and tea if i were to go here i can basically just um take the income of the highest value of one of each type of market that's on my board these spots here allow you to take income for only one specific type of market so if i were to go to this spot over here i would first of all have to turn in a die and then i would get to collect the income of all of the markets that have tea on it up to the value of the die right so if i were to discard this four and say i had five different tea markets on my board then i can reap the benefits of four of them basically the highest valued market exactly and the same holds true for these other two spaces it's just that you would uh collect income from silk and spice the next section is the harbor which is this area here the first person to go there doesn't have to pay anything and then the other ones cost money and so when you go to the harbor you're going to be moving your boat up the river and the river just gets you bonuses and it's whatever the spot says on the board some bonuses will get you diced from the supply some will get you karma which we'll talk about in a second some money so it just really just depends on where you land on the river when you go to the harbor you have to give up a die a value one two or three and depending on the die value you could move up the number of spaces equal to that value so if i were to give up a three i can move up to three spaces now the way that the river works is if i have an opponent in a spot here and say i were to give up a die showing a value of three then i can move one two three right you pretend like the spot that your opponent is on does not exist if you were to ever hop over this bridge space over here then you get a fourth worker because you start the game with three workers but have the potential to have a total of five in the standard game so one worker can be taken from here um if you were to cross this spot on the money track then you get a worker or this spot on the fame track if ever you get your fifth worker then your six worker discus just gets taken out of the game because in the standard game you can only have a max of five and then last but not least we have the palace and the palaces is kind of this whole structure over here this whole bottom portion over here is just a way for you to gain additional dice so if i were to go to this spot i would take a purple dye from the supply and roll it if i were to go to this spot this is the only spot that's that gains you two money and allows you to re-roll any number of dice that you have on your kali statue these spots here allow you to turn in a specific color die for two dice of a different color so this is turning in an orange for two purple dice from the supply and then these spots here give you a benefit depending on the value of die that you've given up the pip value the pip value just really briefly this spot up here requires you to spend a one and that'll get you the first player marker as well as two fame if nobody takes this spot the first player marker will rotate but if you really want to be first next round you can go there the next the dancer over here requires a pip value of two and this will get you any two dice from the supply as well as a white yield token and so you would just take one of these tokens flip it over and gain the bonus this person over here is a value of three this gets you a die from the supply of your choice as well as two karma and so karma we haven't talked about yet but uh this is the karma path over here everybody starts with one karma you can have a maximum of three and so karma what it what it does essentially is you pay one karma and you can take any dice that's in your cauli statue and flip it to its exact opposite side so that one i can convert into a six um you can never go beyond three karma so if i was here and i was to earn more karma it would just kind of lose out or cap out at that and that's essentially how karma works so that's a little bit more dice mitigation yes that is that is one of the main ways that you can mitigate your diet values this next one here requires a fit value of four that gets you a temple upgrade as well as three money this one over here is the master builder and this is the spot that allows the over build on one of these tiles the only real rules here is that each tile can only be over built on once the new tile has to be of a higher value than the previous one and you must pay the difference in dice of the same color as the new tile so that is essentially it these special yields can only be acquired once so you wouldn't be able to do that to get a special yield again yeah so if you went from a tile that's a value 6 to a 10 you would have to give up at least four pip value of that specific color and also the roads still have to make sense and get back to the temple yes your palace yes always and the final uh person at the palace gets you a six buck up on the river exactly six spaces it's not up to it's exactly six so if you are within six spaces at the very end here you cannot take that uh that person's action and i believe that's pretty much yeah the only the last thing that you really need to know are these spots here which are bonuses and that lets you essentially take the action of one of these six well actually one of these five you cannot take the action of this person yeah it shows a two pip value to a six pip value so you're not allowed to land on one of these spaces and take this bonus right here exactly but that is essentially how to play the game once somebody's uh markers intersect then the game will end and that person will win so we're just going to get cleaned up and we'll get started with the play through okay so we are ready to play uh we figure out who goes first by first rolling all of our dice whoever has the lowest total sum is the first player so no rock purposes today not today not today okay one popped out but that's okay so we can keep it yeah two fours and two sixes not the best roll so we are going to play it where if a die pops out it's okay you can still maintain the value all right let's see oh wow he's even wearing two twos four and a one so monique will be going first tinker yeah because my my total value is what four five six seven eight nine uh yes i believe so and then mine is at 12. all right so your first player i'm gonna go first because i'm first i only start with three money to naveen's four so naveen's got one money on me and i get the first player uh elephant elephant yes all right so are you ready to begin yeah okay let's do it all right so karma is we each have one karma so if you roll low it's not too bad because you could use your karma yes the last thing that i didn't mention by the way uh in the teach is that we have bonuses on these score tracks we'll talk about them when we when we get there but just know that they exist all right so starting with me since all of my dice are such low value i can't actually build any of these um right from the get-go so i'm going to start by going to the harbor to get more nice that is a free spot okay yes so i have to turn in uh a one two or three i'm gonna turn in this blue one okay and that's gonna allow me to move up one space on the river and this river spot just gives me two dice of my choice from the supply so i think i'm gonna take uh let's get let's go two purple two purple let's see oh my gosh i hope i roll high that was a stinker roll 65 that is very good five i'll take it okay all right back to you what are you gonna do you know i think i'll go river too so uh well it's well it's the cheapest it can get i'm gonna while it's hot yeah i'll go here uh spend one so now we're even on money uh and then i'm gonna give up my green two okay okay so i can move up to two spots and i will do that so i'm going to skip you one two i'm gonna get four coins money right out the bat so you go to seven yeah because as soon as i can get to this i get an extra worker and of course in euro games more workers means more actions yeah so always get more workers maybe maybe maybe that's not true as long as you have dice all right so back to me yep i'm going to build now i'm going to the quarry because this is the cheapest that it'll be so i have to spend one coin to do so and i'm going to build now that i have this fantastic dice i'm going to build this uh this tile sure it's going to cost me 10 minimum of 10 uh purple dice and so i have to spend these two for a total of 11. so there's no change so she over overpaid i did but that's okay that's true yeah it happens it does and so where do i want to go i'm gonna go this way oh yes i'm gonna go this way like that because it connects me to a special yield so i'm gonna gain three money because it my path connects to that as well as additional two and two because those are two markets that give me two each so three four five six seven months yeah that's really good so seven eight nine so i go all the way up there and that's me pretty good thank you all right i think i need to get some dice so i will go you know actually i'm gonna switch it up i'm gonna go to the palace instead so i'll go here and it cost me a two pip value dies so i'm gonna spend the two blue yep it goes out uh i'm gonna take one of these eight uh little bonus tokens here nice i love them and let's see what i get oh i get an extra dice nice so i'm turning that one dice in for one two three dice total nice okay let's keep these yeah because we do reshuffle those if need be so i will take two blue and let's three dice that's awesome you know i'm gonna take three blue let's do it so oh heavy blue immediately roll them all what is this tile that you want six four three okay that's not bad at all not bad okay that's me all right so back to me um this is my last turn of the round i really heavily also want to push for my some cash fourth worker actually i think i'm going to go here since this spot is free yes and so this is a really really good spot because it doesn't cost anything and only one person go there and walk around so it lets me cash in on one of each type of market on my board since these two markets are of different types it's perfect so i can score for both so i'm gonna get four money which lets me go past this bonus so it goes one two three four so i get this bonus which is moving one space up on the river giving me two karma so you're max yeah so you want to use it now the last time we played this i uh ran out of karma and i had a really hard time gaining it and karma is a really beautiful way of mitigating your dice very simple yeah so then this chip gets flipped over to its opposite side and it gets placed onto the next uh bonus spot which would be right there and what that says it's very tiny uh the next time you hit it or cross it you're gonna get two dice of your choice yes and it just completes and it just continues to just flip like that along the way and the reason why that's there by the way is because if i were to go back by spending money i can't re gain that that bonus had that token be sat there then we would kind of forget yeah so that's a good way to kind of mitigate that okay so it's back to me for your final turn yes so i will go and do exactly what you did and i'm going to spend two yep so goes one two and i'm gonna buy which one with my six four this ten blue so it's very similar to the one that you have it's actually identical to the one that you have but now we both are in business oh no that means we're going to be competing for this yes but and i go first next round so oh we'd rub it in so this will go here and so i have the exact same situation here where i get the three bonus plus another uh four so seven total seven so to twelve to twelve yeah or you land on your bonus marker so you get to to go up on the river as well then i get to go up here nope you're ready oh i'm sorry uh i get to go up here yep and so well that's nice for you i opened that up for you yeah thank you so now i get to take the benefits of any one of these i do not have to pay the dice that's shown correct and you could also take this even though you've taken it before right which might be the one i do i don't know why i point these things out no i'm thinking i'm definitely not over building what am i doing i think moving up six on the river's a little too early well let's see one two three four five six yeah you could rush it get your last worker no in a round or two okay since i was a big fan of it the first time i will do that one right so let's get a bunch of dice so let's let's flip one of these and i get three money this is perfect oh this is great because i was really thinking about going to this one which would give me three money yeah i'll take three all right and then you get two dice and then two dice on my chicken three wow so i have uh my eyes set on something this is beautiful because naveen's gonna be the first player next round and he's gonna start with five dice like dice are like they're they're more important than money i think that is the main currency in this game so you really don't ever want to find yourself without dice exactly touch you know i will go for blue i'm gonna go for it so let's take these two okay and we're gonna roll them up two two oh that's okay okay it's not the best but i'll take it well all right that marks the end of the round so all you really do is we're gonna pla pass the first player elephant bean i need to take your workers back take your workers back in real simple real easy and then now we begin again okay so now that i'm first and this is the one time this will probably be available i'm gonna do it now push in your hand yeah so i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna get uh four total because i have two different markets oh are you gonna be short you are one short that's okay of your fourth worker that's okay yeah that's not too bad okay all right so back to me uh i don't have i have kind of slim pickings here oh this is great actually well you can spin your two die and go there i could set my two die and go here sure because i can go one two and that gets me um it gets me purple dice equal to however much karma i have yes three let's do it i'm gonna go ahead and uh place my worker here at the harbor and i'm gonna spend this purple two okay so i can move up to two spaces on the river and do that and i am gonna do it one two nice so that is gonna get me um three purple dice because i have three karma right so can i have please thank you oh i hope i roll high two okay not a total value bad and you have all that karma to flip your one to a six so it's really good yeah it's true all right back to you okay so i will go to the quarry like you said uh it's gonna cost me one coin okay uh and then uh i am going to spend one of my karma so my only karma and i'm going to convert this uh two into the opposite side which is a five okay and i'm going to give up this seven blue to take that tile this tile yeah okay all right i think this will get me my worker so i'm gonna put this one definitely going this way and the reason why i'm going this way is because it gives me the opportunity to get these yeah bonuses here in the future which is an extra dice and five coins beautiful uh because i place this down i get two coins which is exactly one two where this worker is sitting nice you got your worker and so this worker comes to me and now i can use it uh going uh forward from this round starting on my next turn yeah not only you have a temple i do yes so i have one of those it's this one you get two things yep now if it's hard to see you know from above the fame track is worth to money yes so that's why the fame kind of it's harder to earn fame but it pushes you further on the track so if you can get to this spot you'll get an upgrade you get an upgrade and then if you get to the 15 fame then you get your uh your fifth worker or if we get to this part of the bridge uh the fifth worker yeah okay ah maybe you've got me that two spot is nice but you have a lot of dice so i you know what i am gonna go here because i'm going to use this just kind of like as a setup round since i'm going to go first uh next round assuming naveen doesn't take that but i'm going here and i'm turning in this uh orange tube and i'm going to first take my bonus and it is a karma oh so it's a waste there's nothing there but it's a it's a it's basically essentially she blocked me out from going here and it's a glorified one of these oh my gosh what a stinker that's okay should have spent the karma huh you have to spend your car in conjunction with spending a die so i wouldn't actually have been able to do it there but anywho let's get some dice let's go blue blue so blue two blue good luck or actually should i just take green i have green right there i do have green yeah two green two green yeah you kind of gotta hit it hard while you can yeah okay let's see nice oh there you go nice values very good okay so back to you so i am a little jealous of your green and i'm looking at those green tiles out there and they're looking kind of nice so i'm going to do a conversion i'll move here and this forces me to give up a purple of any pip value to take two green so i'll take a couple green oh perfect no karma at all that's not good was beautiful okay oh you have a fourth worker uh i do have a fourth worker and because i have a one pip die i could maintain going first don't do that i could unless you go with your last worker that's i don't ah that's what a bad role can do for you okay for my last action i'm going to i'm going to give up this purple four okay you know what i have to place my worker first i'm going there nice i'm gonna give up the purple four it's gonna get me an upgrade which i think well let's take the three money first so this is gonna go to 16. sure and um i'm gonna go with this one yeah it seems like the most obvious choice because we can see two in the green yeah and one at least in the blue yeah right it makes the most sense so that's me i'm out for the round naveen still has a worker all right i think i have to do it don't do it because i have one of each type of a market so to go first would mean i can get six money i don't see why i wouldn't do this so i'm gonna go here uh and i'm gonna maintain having the elephant what a first player thinker uh cost me my one green pip die i get two fame and i maintain this elephant oh my gosh i have to stink master so had you spent your one i probably would have went here and then gone up three fame to get to this bump or spent my two value to get to the four money so you know there's some stuff but i had to maintain that all right that is the end of the round let's let's clean up so you keep these maintain this and no problem just take our workers back so i have four workers yeah way to rub it in yeah i'm just explaining to everyone i'm just kidding i'm just bitter okay with myself okay all right naveen where are you to go well i think you know where you're going i think i have to do this now while i have one of each type of market so it's two two two so six total six yeah where are you at is this twenty yeah so twenty is this twenty one two three twenty goes to 26. i can't see i'm not wearing my glasses that's fair to prepare okay so back to me i'm gonna go here okay to the quarry i have to spend one yeah i'm gonna build and i'm gonna turn in um i could i'm going to spend a karma you are going to spend a couple well actually hold on the opposite of four is three isn't it yeah it's the same if you're gonna buy nine there's no yeah there's no need to do a waste of karma i'm just gonna spend these two then to take the green nines that was ten i overpaid a little bit but that's fine and i'll put it right there yes that's a good setup that's a good set up and you get three coins for doing so yeah i get three money for this market so it's gonna go one two three oh my gosh i am so close to this person so you do have now uh if it's hard to see you have two spice markets so now this becomes way more uh kind of lucrative that was the goal yeah because i wanted to have options seeing as naveen is going to tap this as often as he can if i can take it i will probably take it and i think you would yeah okay i think i'm gonna do a cube conversion round right here or turn so i'm gonna go and turn my green into two blue so hopefully i can oh i was like what cubes he meant dice yeah five and two okay nice okay all right back to me i'm going back to the quarry let's just take this while it's still cheap now naveen has to pay three or four so that's cost me two money one two and then turn in these two uh purple for a total of five to take this oh you are spice heavy now that's spice heavy i was like fine you want to take this spot i'll take the spice so are you gonna close off your route but take with two bonuses are you gonna keep it going oh yeah i didn't think about that well if you take the five money for sure then you're in good shape i'm closing out the route okay because i still have this way if i wanted to go like that okay so i'm gonna do this um and it connects to this five plus the two for the market so seven total so 16 is going to go to 23. get your worker and get my worker yes and then i also connect to that that gets me a die of my choice okay ooh i'm gonna take a purple purple actually because uh if i want to get more green i need the purple so it doesn't matter what the value of that is all right that's me hmm so happy i got that worker okay so i'm going to do this spot uh it's going to be the roll re-roll your dice spot so i get two points okay so one two and i'm gonna re-roll i'm gonna re-roll these two blue all right just something better just those two huh oh no shoot you need karma i do i have bad karma right now for going first dang bad karma bad karma okay if you had karma you can you can choose which you know yeah which values you go well that's a shame yeah i'm going to convert i'm going to go right there turning in this purple for two green sure i have two green please green okay thank you let's see please that's not bad that's a good rule it's really good okay okay well seeing as i rolled a bunch of twos i'm gonna go back to that two spot let's take a bonus  and it gets me a third cube they're dying dice so it does come sorry yes uh it cost me this cube shaped dice right here at this too uh but i'm gonna take it back so i get three total in return so and i think there are only two of each type of bonus i believe so so you took the the last dye bonus so i definitely want another blue okay so i'll take one blue and i'll take two green so just to roll these up come on something good okay six one five how many workers do you have left i have no workers perfect so that's me yeah you can do i'm gonna go first anything you'd like okay so for my last worker i'm gonna turn in two of these are you know actually good with corey sure okay so let's start with that it's been three i have to spend three that was expensive one two three okay but i'm gonna spend these two for a total of nine okay fine green for this nice because it includes the one temple that i have upgraded and i'm gonna place it right here it's okay to cut off that path because everything still connects back to the palace and you get five feet and there really is no need for me to connect that way yeah but it's gonna get me three fame for this temple since i'm upgraded and then two fame for this one so for a total of five one two three four five and now i get another upgrade so i might as well what's what's uh what's good here so you have one green dice which we know can convert into two blue dyes so depends on how you want to assess that i think i will bump up on this temple okay i just go right there nice and that's it that is that's everything for the round sure yeah so now i get you are elephant yes finally we take back our workers okay and we both have four workers now so this is good yes very very good very good i was real jealous uh okay so starting with me i don't have a whole lot of dice so i don't really have wiggle room to mess around to get rid of that so quickly so i think i'm gonna take the spot that naveen was taking sure go right there it's free i can uh do one of each type oh gosh i don't have that third spice so you can get a max five total because this spice is worth three this one is worth two or so is that so you want to take the best value i could technically go here spend that die and get seven that's pretty good but i don't want to spend that die that's the problem so i think i just i'll just go with that okay and uh get five money so from here to one two three four five all right so now it's to you very very good okay so i will go to the quarry then uh well it's cheap i will go down one yeah and then with my two fives i have a total of ten blue and i'm going to take this one nice it's a nice crossroads which is great and i'll place it right over here ah so what that's gonna do it's gonna give me the five bonus plus the three on it yeah i'll get eight total okay so it's eight what do you where what is this is this one seven so it goes in 35 uh 35 yes i'm sorry oh 35 right there so you get you're an extra two dice two plus one three three dice size i'm trying the beans in the dice the cube game yeah i am so which three would you like let's take a look okay i'm gonna take a blue a green and an orange so let's just diversify okay nice you did different colors yeah i'm impressed thank you okay that's me all right so back to me i think i this is like a oh i could go up the river i will because it's the same thing if i go here i get two blue but if i go up the river i can get as many dice as i want of your color you want i get whatever color i want not as many dice all right so let's go there i've given up the three and that way i can kind of push further up the river one two three you get two dice on your choice uh two dice of my choice it's funny i think i'm still just gonna get blue i would have gone there yeah two blue okay let's go to blue here we go you have all that karma to turn that one into a six that's true okay so i will go to the quarry okay that's gonna cost me two all right one two and i am going to buy or get this blue one right here so it's gonna cost me a total of five total five so three and two all right there you go check this out i think i'm gonna start building out this way so then because i'm building connecting to that three value i get uh two plus three so five five money yeah so one two three four five that's me nice all right so back to me i am going to go back up the river so i'm gonna spend this coin this one money i don't know if it's worth actually spending the money but i'm gonna do it and i'm going to spend my one pip die to move here because it moves me up one and that way i can take this yes because i was thinking i'll turn it in for two orange but i can still have two dice yeah a bonus a bonus of choices if it's not karma yeah oh free bumps a free upgrade yeah a free travel upgrade i think i'm going to diversify it i'm going to go up this way yeah that's really good then i get two dice of my choice let's go with two green two green okay yes please thank you oh i lost it it's gone all right let's see six and one got that karma yeah i'm talking about the karma that's true all right back to you one more worker huh okay i think i will go back to the quarry we're just gonna build build build so it's two three money three money so one two three and uh i'm going to build this another crossroads i like these so that's eight total so i'm gonna overpay here with my six and four okay it's gonna go there but i'm gonna build it here allowing me to open up this whole path it's gonna get me uh two coins back so i get a little refund two and uh because i connected to this bonus i get two dice now yes and naveen of course took the tile that i wanted those crosses are nice because it gets you just so many options so uh let's take back i'll go a purple and a green okay let's go purple and green nice oh come on two and one no karma to use to help me date it all right then i'm gonna i don't know this is kind of tough but i think i'm going to go here and go back to the harbor nice i'm playing the river game this time i almost never do this but one two okay and i'm gonna spend this one nice so i can just go up here and get three blue dice yeah because i still have so much karma right so yeah the ratio is uh for every karma that she has she gets the dice so nice i kind of put a lot of value in the dice right now for some reason and that's me that's good because your blue can now convert to orange in the next round so it's true i have a two let's just do it now okay so i will go here i will spend my two to get a token bonus three money perfectly again when i got the three money i debated spending my four here uh so then i get two dice of my choice and i'll take two green let's go for it okay okay six and four okay there we go that's nice that's something we can work with that is something yep all right done that's me yep all right that is the end of the round here you go elephant for you nothing for me and we get back our workers one two three four i just did uh all the the harbor stuff you did you went harder hard i did so it starts with you i think uh do we know where you're going i think i should the sad thing is if i do it i get the money bonus and i would move here i'd get one purple dice for every karma i have i have no karma so yeah it is but it would just it would push me along a little bit but i think i'll have to do it let's do it so we'll go here i get a total of six coins or i'm sorry i think i might get a little bit more than now it's one two three for the spice four five six seven total wow so now we're at 47. uh i do get this bonus of the one harbor bump because again i have no karma but you don't get the benefit of the bonus exactly yeah there's no carmine no karma that's unfortunate carmelis okay all right well i two will go up the river but i'm gonna go on this spot i'm gonna give up this one nice because it just it pushes me up here which is funny because it's six money i would have only gotten five had i gone here it was just better anyway better yeah so one two three four five six oh my gosh that's a bonus yeah naveen is closing in i i gotta get the feeling a little bit yeah i mean i need karma too yes okay back to you okay i think i'm gonna go and do a re-roll oh okay here i get two too many two money one two and i'm gonna reroll all my ones i don't like them you don't you don't to have first player oh wait actually you rolled another one i rolled another one oh okay well that's fine by me all right i'm gonna go to the to the quarry it's been a while since i've built the tile so i have to spend a money and and i'm actually going to spend a karma the game will be done on one please flip this over to its other side which is a five nice and i'm gonna turn these both in so two fives for a total of ten to take this blue blue knife nice and i'm gonna go straight down we're just going to ignore this side of the estate and you do the tile first before any bonuses yes so this is three money because of the market so one two three and this temple gets me three fame so one two three getting closer getting closer uh well and then i also get this uh special yield which is a one upgrade one temple upgrade and a die yep so i'm gonna upgrade this to its final spot yeah let's go all the way four and then i'm gonna take a green die okay please thank you let's see two and again with that bonus specifically the reason why it's ruled that way is because this style has a temple on it so it's not like muni could take the bonus here move up that and then score the extra fame right that would be a little bit unfair a little bit to me to you okay yeah so uh i'm going to place my worker in the quarry so it's going to cost me two i'm going to spend this complete eight on the yellow and take that middle one yeah exactly it is orange but i'm just kidding maybe it's yellow maybe i'm wrong okay so all right i'll place it here kind of so i can kind of get towards these bonuses here uh i have no movement here on these so i get two and two so four feet in one two three four i'm with you past that bonus so now you can get a little upgrady yeah let's take a look all right i'll just move up this one okay why not perfect all right back to me i too i'm gonna go back to the quarry so it's getting a little expensive one two three you know i keep getting closer to this back this is really tantalizing but um i'm gonna spend these two sure so it's a total of eight green to take this time nice and i'm gonna completely just ignore that because i do need to to connect to other things over here so i'm going down this way and it has two temples it has this one so mine is four fame and then this one for three so the total of seven fame and i think that's gonna get me my last worker one two three four five six seven or i guess i should have left you there yeah sorry so i take my last worker which means this worker is out of the game because in the standard game you can only have five five yeah so that's me that's very good that's very very good thank you i was happy with that okay i think i'm gonna do a conversion i'll go to this green spot and convert my one green into two blue okay so that's your last uh last action last action round six and one okay that'll work which means i'm gonna get first player no matter what that's great okay so i have two two actions here i'm gonna first go to this spot let's go oh you are gonna do it turn in the six because i don't really care too much about well i have less karma so like these spots are not as worth it and so these spots are pretty nice they are nice i would really like to try to get there so it's going to make me go exactly six spaces one two three four five six which let me take a different spot on here i think i'm gonna go you gotta go there yeah yeah so i can have some dice so no matter what if you draw karma you're fine yeah let's see three three money three money that's good so one two three so close and two dice what do i want here let's go with two purple two purple two purple dice thank you non-threatening purples yes because i don't want to spend any more money sure yeah so i'm going to turn in this this two i'm going to get another the last token and these are going to get reshuffled and placed back here so that gets me another dice that's great go ahead yeah to go into the next round let's make them all orange all orange three orange no threats in the orange that's good yes so it's all you well is that really no sorry all all blue what am i thinking very different all blue good things yeah very different i would have sealed my fate yeah thank you okay here we go oh those are nice six three three six three three and that's it that is the end of the round so i get the elephant and we take back our people two three four and five that's a good count one two you can try to get your fifth worker for i'd like to yeah at some point all right let's get a status check so i'm over here with my money counter and my fame is over here so i have a little bit of a distance i think we're definitely in the last uh third of the game though because this goes quickly it does naveen i think they mean i have a money lead but not a fame lead here so i think your money lead is still larger than my family so yeah but you have an extra worker that's true and you are set up on these tracks way better than i am so so we shall see how the rest of the game uh pans out so i think it's me sure right i'm first yep so i'm gonna go and take that sweet sweet spot it's been a while i uh really missed it right so i have a three three and a two so that one of each yes so three six eight eight money two three four there you go okay and then i'm going to take this it lets me take two dice from the supply so i'll make them both orange orange yeah i'm gonna put that over there thank you oh no i see what you've done see oh five and three okay perfect uh all right so it is over to you hmm i don't like anything i see one bit so you like anything new okay i will go where no man has gone before that's fine so i'm gonna build for one okay and uh i'm gonna build that green in the top right corner this one yeah what it cost us a five so i'll pay my six okay and i will take that there you go and i'm gonna place that right here connecting to this bonus here so i get seven plus uh this one uh three fame so i will take the three fame so one two three and then you move yourself yeah so i think i'm a little short here that one two three four five six seven oh my gosh you're so close i'm moving all right so i'm gonna go and go to the quarry before things really uh get bad so it's gonna cost me two one two and i'm going to spend a karma to flip this blue this blue three into a four so that i can combine these two you're getting that twitter yeah so there you go and it has to connect back to the palace so i'm pretty much going yeah um so how many fame is that six so it's this temple so that's two two and this one so that's six all right so where are you right there oh yeah so it's one two three four five six yeah okay so i'm making my way you're rounding this is this is if this isn't the last row i don't know we're getting really close close yeah so back to you okay so i'm gonna go back to the quarry so it's gonna cost me three so we're gonna go back one two three and i'm gonna buy that four blue over there with an overpay with my six yep okay there you go all right and so let's go ahead and slip this one in here so that's gonna get me three fame plus i connected to this so seven fame nice so i'm gonna get my worker one two three four five six seven and i have a workout [Laughter] life's work finally it is my life's work wow okay that was a little bit tough but that last work it's a lot of work the fourth worker is like okay and then that fifth workers yeah is the struggle okay so this one goes out this is out of the game good job naveen thank you all right so back to me i'm gonna go back to the quarry as well spending all your money which is not good because i'm technically going backwards i'm going backwards but one two three it has to happen sometimes it's worth it because i'm gonna spend my last karma to flip uh this to a four so it's four side combine the two for the nine yeah there's nine orange and i'm going to have it go this way so that it gets uh additional three fame that's what that special yield gives me so it's this temple and this one the same is it and ten fame yes so it's uh yeah four five six seven eight nine ten yes wow so you're gonna go from 21 to 31 so you get to move up the boat oh wait i get this first you do get this that's important so you get a double carpet one too because of where i landed oh yeah so that's a one bump on the boat a one bump on the boat okay so i just hop over the bridge and so that's gonna get me one green dye per karma so you gotta get two green dye wow that was a really important uh order of operations there very good okay okay five and three so back to you well i'll do this while it's cheap uh let's go ahead and place myself on the river okay and i'm gonna spend my one blue die to move up one space and get three fame one two three hey that's good something yeah that's not bad okay well i'm gonna go um over here okay i'm gonna exchange this blue yeah for two two orange dice please thank you please roll hi oh hey oh no i see what you're going for that is not bad shoot all right okay i think i'm gonna go back to the river so we'll go here it's gonna cost me one and i'm gonna spend my three purple and i'm debating do i wanna go one two or do i wanna go one two three i think i will go one two three definitely that yeah and then i might take this action here that's just a better version than that it is a better version than that that's that's why uh let me uh choose start shuffling these sure all right there you go fully shuffled okay so let's take a look good luck be something i need three coins i'll take three coins not bad progresses me one two three and i get two dice oh my gosh we're so close i'll take two green dice why not all right all right come on roll up here roll extremely high ones three and four that's nice kind of meet us in the middle there oh no no no didn't take sides no no no okay go ahead okay for my last action i am gonna go to the quarry as expensive as this is i'm just going to do it one two three what are you buying oranges yeah i'm gonna buy this tile right here which is orange ten so these two fives okay and it's gonna go right here it's a beaut yeah it's nice isn't it it is nice yeah and so it's this temple four which is four and this one's seven total seven female gosh one two three four five six seven oh so close ah okay i have another worker so that means i'm going first that that's good this is where it really feels like a race yeah like in this like last round or two so i get to go two turns in a row because it's this and then you did not take that one spot so that's good okay so you have to go back to back you could set up your move and i'm drawing okay i think this is the right thing to do i'm gonna spend my uh green dye and uh we are gonna go up the river no no i'm sorry not up the river oh we are gonna go uh to one of these spots here and i think i have the most uh let's see spice so i have three four five six so if i spend this three dice i can cash in three different spice markets and i will get six coins so i'm gonna do this okay this is gonna go here we're gonna go up one two three four five six nice oh so you get the dish yeah and this is done i think there's no more spots where you get the benefits anymore so that just goes out and now i get to die yeah that was worth it yeah i was wondering like why didn't you just go up the river or something but yeah that makes sense i'll take two blue let's go with two huh two blue since you don't have any blue i'd like to not compete with you trying to bag four and one come on come on come on come on come on well that's it that's another pharma so badly i know i was gonna recommend that three because that's a nice spot two karma just two karma two karma and a die i know that's pretty good i was hoping for a good roll uh well luckily you get to go first right so take back your workers three five people now four or five yeah now we both have five so this is most likely going to be the last round i imagine it's getting pretty close here yeah so starting with you naveen okay i think this is the best i can do for points right now so i'm just gonna take this spot and get my seven money so it's the three four five six seven so we're going to go one two three four five six seven to zero trying to close the gap oh close i know it didn't i didn't have to spend a die to do that so i feel like that was a good thing this is so close i can't believe this oh my gosh okay uh well i'm gonna go to the quarry because that's kind of where my my mind's at right now so it does take me a step back which is annoying but i am actually going to uh spend a karma okay you will be done please to turn this into a four sure and then combine these two for a green the green nine nice right here so this is gonna go here you go okay thank you it's gonna go right here and it's gonna get me three uh money one two three and four fame and four fame because it's this temple so one two three four oh close and the special yield is two dice so can i have um i'll take two orange two orange okay yes or should i do orange ah let's do two blue instead actually two blue yeah i was mistaken there okay i didn't roll them yet so here we go please two and four all right two four i do have one cardboard in the bank so you do you're done yes so it's back to you um i'm really uh not happy with my dice but i i need to get a bonus here to keep moving so uh i think i will go to the quarry it's gonna cost me two so go back one two uh and i'm gonna spend my two uh green dye okay for uh that middle one right there this one because it's gonna allow me to cut off to this fame versus taking that one over oh okay i was wondering i was like hold on all right there you go that's uh it's uh three money is gonna come back to me plus three fame so we'll go uh whoops it's gonna go one two three and then three fame which gets me karma one two three so now i have two karma hey tough yeah it's it's hard when you run out of karma yeah you definitely want to have that uh okay so back to me i'm going to go to the quarry yeah this has to say one two three this might be oh no might be it i'm gonna spend my last karma okay to flip this to its opposite side which i believe is a five and i'm gonna turn these two in for this okay what is that oh so it's gonna be six money because of the special yield wow and this temple which is four plus this temple which is three mm-hmm so seven fame seven famous three times you got it so one two three four five six and one two three four five six seven that is it [Music] and the oh have crossed and we had an equal number of turns because that was first player i saw i saw the writing on the wall i i had a good early lead and uh you pushed up on those those uh temple tracks and i was trying to i was trying to bulldoze beyond it fame is really fame is very valuable because it comes in twos rather than money where you're pushing forward then you always have to push back to pay for things right yep and so yeah i think upgrading is kind of necessary at some point yeah because you make those doubles um but it was really close that was close look how far you were only what three fame away yeah uh and i had karma now so i could have turned this one into a six yeah and then uh bought some of those some of these yeah i think we were a turn away from each other yeah yep anyway that's it good good job nice well done all right so let's talk about it sure so this is rogers at the guarantees this is not a new game it was released what year was this release i think 2017 a few years ago and uh it's not even a shelf of shame like this uh typically once a month or we will do a shelf of shame video for the patreon but uh this is a game that was requested just off of our shelf that we have already really loved yep exactly so let's talk about it now that i've spilled the beef or how we feel about it yeah well this is one from our collection uh it sits nicely over there yeah uh we have played this several times now and um there is always uh it this is a game that it's very enjoyable to take a break from and then come back to and rediscover it yeah because there is um kind of there's clearly you have to go up the money track and you have to clearly go up the fame track so it can get slightly a little bit like you're doing the same thing over and over but there is an expansion that we just got recently that we have not explored yet which i'm very very excited to play but overall i really really enjoy this game it is a very fun puzzle um how about you what do you think yeah so the first time we ever played this game or the first time i've ever heard about it was at a local convention a few years ago there's this thing the way that the convention works is you can sign up for just like a 101 if you don't want to play the game you just want to learn it and so those are just sessions where they just teach you how to play the game and so naveen i think you sat in i said in one and then i was playing a game downstairs and i just remember you running downstairs saying oh my gosh there is this game where the way that you win is by intersecting two scoring conditions and i thought wow that is unique i haven't heard of a game because i don't know that yeah right so that was kind of what initially uh got us onto this game because we don't typically play games with a lot of dice but the way that this game does dice or handles dices really well it's more of a resource than anything yeah you there's a lot of different ways for you to gain different combinations of dice the main point of it is placing tiles on your board so yeah i really enjoy this game i i know what you mean it can become i don't i don't know if i want to call it sami but you know the whole purpose of the game is just getting dice you're just exchanging dice in a lot of different ways and placing tiles on your board and so that over and over again i guess can potentially get kind of kind of stale but like you said it's really nice to take a break from it and then come back to it and love it just like the first day you played it exactly yeah yeah i think the reason why i say that is because those market tiles it's like well there's these three types of markets on there um and and you're obviously going to try to connect your roads um and so the bonuses on the standard side of the board are clearly okay i want to get to that early five five money i want to get to that three fame and i want to work down towards that bottom center tile uh the combination of how you do it and the way your dice roll and utilizing karma do make it interesting but um whenever you have a good income source you're probably going to always go to that spot and try to tap that income the in the market yeah exactly the popular spot and so that's the only part that for me that aspect of it gets kind of samey but uh overall though you get to do a lot of cool things in the course of the game and so that's exactly why i like to take a break from the game come back and come back now granted we show or today we played the standard version of the game this is like the base version there are two main modes of play there's like uh the advanced side of the board that you flip over and you can kind of customize the special yields you get and so the dancer who is the spot number two in the palace yeah that gets you a bonus yield just you flip it and you get the thing that's different in the advanced game and so that might solve a lot of those kinds of things that you're mentioning yeah that particular dancer in uh in the standard game which is what we played seems pretty overpowered uh because a a two value dice is not the most you know lucrative one like yeah you can go to the river and do something there or you can go to the dancer but you're basically exchanging one dice for two plus a bonus and we noticed the last couple times we played that that that seems to be like a very highly abused spot uh if i'm first player and i see that and i don't have really much going on in the market i'm definitely going to go and do that right yeah so it's a little bit different uh in the advanced version of the game you go to that spot it gets you a bonus that you can now place onto your board for you to achieve later on you don't get the wordpress immediately yeah so that that's kind of interesting how you can customize it but honestly the main reason why we play the standard version of the game is because that is a game that is this the version of the game that we enjoy that we enjoyed first yeah i guess and because it's probably easier for you to kind of understand the flow of the game uh with using that side otherwise like the video is mentioning this game does actually have a few mini expansions we haven't played with any of them yeah but it even came it even comes in its own like little goodie box that you yeah so there was like the mango and i think snake expansion so there were like these mini expansions and they recently i remember recently maybe in the past year yeah year and a half came out with a goodie box that kind of encompasses all the expansions and i think a little bit more content yeah we still have it in shrink so uh now that we've played this a couple times leading up to this we gotta i'm excited to unbox that pretty much today yeah we really got to play with those because i think that the one thing is those those tiles get uh are there's more tiles now so it gets a little more variety exactly that's cool yeah yeah what about the theme you know it's taken us this long to talk about it but this board game is set in india it is yeah what are your thoughts on that uh well it's it's not very thematic in terms of you know what's going on it's a true euro um the art style is very nice it is very thematic in that sense uh that indian style beautiful it's a little bit busy it is a little bit busy it's uh beautiful yeah definitely when the board was first introduced me at that convention that you're talking about i was like what the heck is going on a little culture shock but uh yeah once you understand the flow of the game it's actually very very simple and you understand the layout of everything it makes total sense in terms of theme it's nice always to see an indian theme because i'm indian of course but it's not a very thematic game you're not doing too much in terms of theme but it does set a nice background background or backdrop for the game so you enjoy it i do yeah that's nice yeah i like it too i think it's beautiful it is very beautiful yes it the board skills well for player account we played on the the two player side of the board on the opposite side is for three and four just because of some of the spaces there's a little bit more space right and so in terms of player count how do you feel uh plays well at all player counts yeah we played at all players we have played at all player accounts uh where is my favorite maybe three i want to say maybe uh it plays very well at two though it's nice to be able to go you know back to back i will say that when higher player counts there's the same amount of tiles out there and so everybody starts with the same opportunity with dice so something that you're eyeing could definitely get snatched up a lot faster in a higher player account so you just really have to keep an eye on people's dice yes is what that means exactly that's it becomes a part of your strategy yeah so there's a little more tension i think at a higher player account not that this is not intense i still felt that uh but yeah i think definitely three or four is the sweeter spot but very enjoyable for the amount of time that this game takes yes yeah it's fast at two it is fast we've recently played a four-player game of this so there was a lot of tension i actually think that i prefer the prefer the four player game just because of how tight everything is and just that added stress it's uh it's a nice kind of stress in this game especially because uh you increase your likelihood of several people crossing the finish line at the same time and then now you're like really counting like who crossed it further yeah right there's also i also feel like i guess going into the mechanics um there is a prevalent strategy i think there is and that kind of maybe that speaks to how you feel like it's uh you always want to kind of take a break from it because of that you know in the beginning i find that you need to get money so you're typically going to go for the tiles that provide markets and you're going to try to spam the market because that is one of the easier ways for you to gain your your fourth worker yes that's exactly because who wants to go all the way up that river and that's typically how i feel like it works well because you also need to pay money for a lot of these action spots now granted the last game that we played in that four player game the person who won clearly was neither of us no he did not do that strategy he was doing a little bit of a mix so maybe i'm wrong yes but it does feel like that is kind of what you are going to be doing over and over again when you come back to it in general i think the gameplay is really fun you're really looking for those combos you never want to run out of dice you also don't want to run out of karma right because it's really annoying to now like roll something really terrible and not be able to do anything about it yeah when you know that those tools are there yeah so the biggest thing for me is always trying to make sure that i have dice yes so whether it be getting those bonus spots that get you an extra die when you use your last one or hitting that token yeah or getting your special yields in order to just like passively acquire dice that's kind of a big deal in this game yeah because i don't think in our playthrough we went to the spot where you just put a worker down get a dice and you have these four yeah no that is uh that is a rough spot to go to yeah yeah it does feel good it is yeah anyway that is how we feel about rogers with the ganges what is your what are your final thoughts if anything like i said i really do enjoy the game uh i'm very very excited now to uh open up that box and really see what's in it and see what we can add to this game um replayability may not be there but that's not a bad thing there's many games out there so i can always put this on the shelf come back to it three months later and have a great fantastic time yes we do keep a few games on our shelf as long term games that are exactly like that we can't play them back to back but we love them every time we do bring it out exactly so that is rajas of the ganges thank you so much to our patreon supporters for uh recommending this game to play uh it had been a while since we had last played it and so it was exciting to kind of prep for this and also film it yeah and of course if you like to see more videos like this in the future please consider subscribing thank you bye [Music] you\""

              "\"and now it's time for another diced our review with Tom vassal hey folks I'm Tom vassal and today we're taking a look at a game by incus and Marcus brand called the Rajah's of the Ganges now the brands have been turning into my favorite duo of designers they've made some really great games this year they made the exit games they made a great party game just good stuff across the board so today we're taking a look at this game here when which what is the theme of this game in 16th century India you are being some Raja and you are going to basically be influential in your area okay a lot of the the hootch games don't really necessarily the theme doesn't matter it's all about mechanisms this one has dice in it dice as a resource in the game and you're going to also beat it has an interesting method of victory where to victory point tracks are going to cross here's how plays okay so here's the board and we want to talk about is there's two tracks on the board there's a thing track you'll be moving your marker around on the fame track and you have a money track where you'll be keeping track your money as you pan lose it if you get your money and fame track to cross each other you win the game if multiple people do it on the same turn then whoever has the most famous but the first person to make their two markers cross each other wins now player is gonna be doing that through a worker placement style game you're gonna start with three workers and you've the possibility of getting up to two more if you get your Fame marker past a certain point your money marker or if you move your boat down the river you'll get you can get a worker when you do those once you get your second worker you'll remove your third each player is also going to be utilizing a resource of dice you'll have a little statue here that can hold dice so you can put them in different spots you have enough room to hold different dice each die is a specific number when you get a die as a resource over the course of the game you roll it so you have numbers and colors you also have your own little board here which you're going to be building up now on a player's turn and each turn one person's first that person has this little elephant figure to show they go first you're gonna be placing workers on the board when you place a worker on the board some spots the placement worker are free like for example this water spot here is free to put a worker if I put them in the spot next to it it's gonna cost money and there are spots on the board that are we're gonna require a specific number and there are some spots on the board that will require a specific color the spots down here at the bottom of the Lord are pretty easy these over here just give you a dye you take that color dye and roll it immediately here you can trade in one color for two of another color here you can move your boat down the river you do it on this and you give up a one two or a three dye and then you can move your boat one two or three spaces depending on which dye you've given up when you move a boat down the river you ignore spaces other boats are in so if Green gets three they would go one two three and a spot let you land on gives you some sort of bonus which might be Kharma two dice of your choice three Fame points money sometimes points the ban on things that you've done I just mentioned Fame I should mention that Fame is kept up here in the top of the board and each player has a Cube on Fame and you can move your cube you can lose a Fame to switch a die to its opposite side you can also go over here in the chambers and do different things this will give you the first person marker and two Fame points otherwise first point player marker moves clockwise this gives you two dice of your choice and you get to draw a white chip there's some white chips over here and you'll just draw the chopped chit and sit this one gives me a dive my choice fantastic some of them are going to let you get karma you'll see number 3s you get karma down here you can move your boat six spaces sort of various things that the chambers can do and then there's the the big action here which is expanding your province here in the in the core you're going to be building more things on your province board when you do that you are going to pick which province tile you want they're separated into different piles and colors based on their costs and if I want to build this tile for example I would have to give up eight pips worth of dice now I don't have that as you can see my board so really the only dye that I can build right now is I could build this one here this cost five and I have a sixth eye so I could pay that and then place this on my board when I place a tile my board all I have to do is connect one road so that it goes back to the province you can orient it any way you want when you place it so that it connects to one of these outside bonus spaces you'll get that bonus so here this would give me three coins some give you a diet and give you coins points Fame as you connect these across the board after you place it you're also going to get points and/or money based on what's on it many of the tiles that you place have temples on them sometimes multiple different types of temples whenever you place those you're going to get fame based on where your marker is on that particular temple so if I place out the this temple here and my markers here I'm going to get three Fame points and there's various ways to increase the thing point you get four different temples if you place out markets these are markets here there's three different types of goods for markets you simply get the money that's on them in fact you can get that money later on if you put your workers out here in the marketplace here I can take three different markets and get the money for them or here I can get as many markets are the same type of good as I want worth of money as long as I pay a dye that's equal to that many markets that's pretty much it then you're just going to be continuing going around and around until someone's after ones place their workers the next round begins and then the players the turnover passes to either the player who picked the the Chamber or to the just a next clockwise player you can play with a variant where over here on this side of the board you have various other tiles that you can draw and you can get all sorts of different bonuses from these different tiles today based on how you connect things at the bottom you cannot you would also play with all your workers at once instead of starting with three and getting three more but you would also have spots to keep fewer dice on that side and then finally there's another little module where you basically just have little tiles that you can place on the river to change the spots on the river to different things that's how you play okay so first of all dice you know that I like dice these are really good dice I really like the quality of these dice they look sharp they look good they're fun to roll they look really great my only complaint maybe about the dice is that the dice fit into these spots and the board so I've had players like put their die there instead of the worker which it looks like it should go but it's you put the worker out and you just pay the die the board itself is colorful and looks good I think I might have liked the board slightly bigger I mean it's beautiful and all but some things like this marketplace here in the middle kind of gets lost in the shuffle it's not that easy to see when you're looking at the whole board in general and even though the different temples are different colors and different shapes this still can kind of look kind of like a mess of colors that's being nitpicky though I really do like everything looks I do like how this board looks when you fill it up and I really this is not necessary you could just say you can only keep a dice but having a statue hold your dice is a really cool way to do things the tiles are a little small that you get over here but other than that and I guess stacking these workers up that you keep falling is a bit of a pain but really other than that the whole game works really well I should mention that some of the spots here on the board when you get to them you get some sort of bonus and then this game has a nice thing where you move the tile up farther just in case you lose money so you don't get the bonus again but there's bonuses all over the board here when I my thing gets here I can increase the value of one of my temples and when my fame goes over here I get to karma so there's you know and this stuff is really clear even like where you put the workers at the beginning of the game it shows you so what of a worker so I don't really need to look at anything when I'm setting this game up it's pretty easy pretty great components and I should also mention that everything fits very nicely into the insert which was molded for these exact components which is always a nice thing well first of all you know that like I said beautiful production but this game is just keeps me intrigued the whole time now I do tend to like worker placement games but this one gives me a lot of options and that's something I like in worker placement games but you're utilizing your dice you know I thought and when I played the first time I said man you know why do I even have spots for eight dice here I was constantly running out of dice dice are such a precious resource in fact at the beginning of the game I looked at the board and I said okay there's a spot to put a die a worker you get one dice and I guess if you're doing that you're really you know desperate and then I ended up doing it over the course of the game because when you grab those tiles especially ones that cost nine or ten points to put on your board you can give up a lot of your dice and so the game is doing various things at one time it's a worker placement game where you're collecting resources and you're trying to win again it's you're thinking oh is they trying to get victory points well it could be the fame if you consider those victory points and money now money goes up and down you're spending money to do things so it's fluctuating but if you put your full effort into money you will make it zoom around the board we thought it was interesting that money goes up to like 180 or something is anyone ever never moved their fame and move the money all around the board I doubt it but it's possible likely you're gonna have them cross at one point but you can run one strategy more than others like you can say I'm gonna spend a lot of my money and just shoot that Fame around the board as fast as I can or I'm gonna really push there's many ways you build a lot of markets in the area you can start pumping into money now it's every two money per Fame point the tracks are not you know equal in that regard but that makes sense too because it's easier to get money than fame you know those spots you like when you roll the dice is a one better than a six now a six is almost always better because when you're buying the province tiles higher numbers help however sometimes you want those low numbers that one which lets you go first that's a useful thing the two which gives you lots of extra dice that's pretty handy for one worker and a die and so I kind of like how they kind of balance that out then there's the river race in the middle of the board how fast do you want to run out down it you can run down it really quickly to get your worker but if you take your time you can get a lot of bonuses so the game is all about get bonuses here do this move your temple tracks up so when you place them you score more Fame points and there's a lot of concepts but they all work together pretty seamlessly and you know there's a lot of games out there I'm like you need to play this many times before you grok it this is not one of those this is a game that I think just after a few rounds of playing you're like okay this is how this works now that knowing the best strategies and stuff that's going to come later but I think it works well and the variants both I like the variant that on the river tiles are fine I guess we're people getting bored with the river and but having the all six workers at the beginning a game that definitely changes the game up the game also comes has this quickly approaching climax to it at the beginning of two but on money I moved a little bit unfeigned after a couple turns you like are these ever gonna meet and all sundered it's like and it's a super fast race so yes the game is very mechanical in some senses but the beauty of the game the fun of it you know I like collecting dice and rolling them and I like you know you have your there's several things that you enjoy if you'd like building up your tiles and making roads like Carcassonne that parts in the game if you'd like worker placement that's in the game if you just like getting dice and using those dice to do things that's in the game and there's not a ton of interaction but there is you know blocking other players but there's also all different cool little bonuses you get for doing things and when you finish it you have a bit of a sense of accomplishment and I do like that so recommend it for me I enjoyed this one a lot Raja's up the Ganges diced our judgment approved thanks so much for watching the diced our videos find more great videos and reviews

              "\"Hello and welcome to another episode of how to play by Cat House Gaming. Our goal in this series is to give you and your tablemates the foundational game mechanics needed to you playing in a short amount of time. I know you'd rather be gaming so let's get started. Hey guys today's game is Rajas of the Ganges. In Rajas of the Ganges each player is Indian royalty tasked with improving their estates into wealthy provinces through the trading of silk, tea, and spices as well as by building impressive structures to awe current and future generations. Rajas of the Ganges is a game for two to four players combining several game mechanics including worker placement, tile laying, and dice rolling. It has an interesting end game trigger and scoring mechanism. End game is triggered when a user's fame marker passes their money marker. The current stage and not the round is completed which means that all players between the person who triggered end game and the person with with the start player marker get one additional turn. After that players count the number of spaces between their fame and money markers. This is often a negative number. Place the game board in the middle of the table and ensure the appropriate side for the number of players is face up. The elephants at the bottom right of the board indicate if the board is the 2 player version or if it is the 3 and 4 player version. If you are playing with 3 players, place the 3 player tokens in the quarry and in the harbor. This is the only player count adjustment. Place the white yield tiles face down on the top most building and shuffle them. The other yield tiles are not used in a basic game. Place the dice near the board in easy reach of the players. Creating two piles on either side of the board best ensures everyone can reach them as needed. Sort all of the province tiles first by color and then by animal type. Shuffle the stacks and place them near the board. They should be organized in columns by color with the animals ascending from snake, to bull, to tiger. Once sorted, they should be flipped so that the animal side is down and the roads, markets, and buildings are visible. Each player selects a player color and takes all of the components of that color. They place their Kali statue in front of them as well as one of the Provence boards. Take a look at the perimeter of the province board and place it with the white yield tiles face up for the basic game. Place 3 of the meeples onto the castle of the province board. Take 4 dice, one of each color and roll them immediately. Place the dice as they have been rolled onto the hands of the Kali statute. The player who had the lowest dice role is the start player and receives the elephant. The start player places their money token on the 3 space of the money track. The player to their left places theirs on the 4. A third player would start on the 5 and a 4th player starts on 6. All players place their fame marker on the zero space of the fame track, their boat on top of the boat in the river, and their cardboard disk river side up on the 12 spot of the money track. They each place a meeple on the designated meeple spaces which are located on the fame track at 15, the money track at 20 and along the river on the bridge. Lastly each player places a cube under the 2 fame spot for each of the 4 building types as well as on the karma track at the 1. Each round consists of the players taking a single action per player in a clockwise manner. The round ends once each player has used all of their available meeples. It is quite possible that one player will have more turns than the other players if they have retrieved one or both of their extra works from the board. At the end of the round the start player marker transfers to either the person who played on the Great Mogul or to the person to the left of the current start player. All players retrieve their active workers and game play resumes with the new start player. On their turn the player will take one of their meeples and place it on the board immediately paying the cost and performing the action of that space. Both the cost and the benefit are denoted near the space upon which the player places their meeple. The cost is either free, a specific amount of money, a die or possibly both money and dice. It’s useful to point out that at any point in their turn, players can adjust the value of their dice by spending a karma. One karma allows the player to flip a die over so a one would become a six and vice versa. Actions can be taken in 4 different areas of the board: The palace allows you to consult with trusted advisors for benefits or obtain additional dice for future turns The quarry which allows you to add province tiles to your province board The market place which allows you to earn income based on the markets on your province board The harbor allows you to advance along the river and receive special bonuses In the palace, there are 6 advisors you can visit. Each requires dice of a specific value. The Great Mogul requires you to turn in a die with a single pip. You immediately earn 2 fame points and he grants you the start player marker at the end of the round. Visiting the Dancer requires you to turn in a die with 2 pips and in return you receive 2 dice of your preferred color or colors. You also flip over one of the white yield tiles and take that benefit as well. Visiting the Yogi requires a die of 3 pips which increases your karma 2 spaces and grants you a die of your choice. Please note that the maximum karma level is 3. The Raja Man Sing requires a die with 4 pips and in return you move your cube one column to the right on the building type of your choosing and receive 3 money. Visiting the Master builder requires a die of 5 pips and allows you to build over an existing province tile on your province board once you pay the difference in the cost. It must be a tile of higher value than the old tile. Lastly, players may visit the Portuguese turning in a die with 6 pips which allows you to move your boat exactly 6 unoccupied spaces on the river and receive the designated bonus of the space upon which you land. Within the palace there are also terraces and balconies where you can turn in a die of a particular color, in this case blue, and receive 2 dice of another color, orange. You can also get a free die of a specific color. Lastly you can earn 2 money and reroll as many of your current dice as you would like. Players going to the quarry spend money and dice to build the province tile of their choice. The amount of money varies from 1 to 4 and is indicated by the location of their meeple within the quarry. The dice to be turned in must match the color of the province tile selected and the pip value must meet or exceed the cost of the tile. Province tiles are immediately placed on the players province board. All tiles must originate from the residence at the top of the board. Roads are crucial for future tile placement. A tile that dead ends cannot be played off of in subsequent turns without being rebuilt via the Master Builder in the palace. When the tile is placed, the player immediately gains the benefits identified on the tile as well as any of the yield tiles the road connects to. The player receives money equal to the value of any markets on the tile. They receive fame based on the building pictured on the tile and their progress on the corresponding buildings bonus track. For example, if the player is building a gold building and their cube is in the 3 fame column for gold buildings, they would move their fame marker 3 spaces. Additionally, if the road connects to a yield tile, they will also receive the bonus indicated on the board. When building atop existing province tiles via the master builder within the palace, the player must upgrade from a lower to higher value tile and pay the difference in the pip values. When it is rebuilt the yield tiles pictured on the board do not reactivate but the player does receive the money and / or fame benefits of the tile. A tile can only be rebuilt once. There are 5 spaces available in the market place. Each one allows players to activate the markets on their province boards and earn additional money. The 3 spaces on the top row are for each of the 3 specific market types: tea, silk, and spices. Players going to these spaces turn in a die and activate the number of the designated market places on their province board up to the number of pips on the die turned in. The player receives money based on the value of the markets activated. If the player cannot activate all of their specific markets of that type, they get to choose which markets to activate. The 2 market spaces on the bottom row allow players to activate 1 market of each market type on their province board. There is no cost to perform this action but the same player cannot visit both of these spaces. This is denoted by the 2 different shades of meeple pictured to the left of the selection spaces. If the player has multiple markets of a given type, the player selects which market to activate. A visit  to the harbor allows players to move along the river. The cost varies from free to 2 money as well as a die of 1, 2, or 3 pips. Players who turn in a die of 1 pip, a move a single, unoccupied space along the river. A die with a value of 2 allows the player to move 1 or 2 spaces and a die value of 3 allows the player to move 1, 2, 3 spaces. Please note that there can never be more than one boat on a given river space with the exception of the first and last spots. Occupied spaces do not count when moving along the river. The player will immediately take the benefit offered by the river space their boat stops on. Please refer to page 19 of the rule book for questions on the river symbols. As your fame and money markers travel along their respective tracks, there are bonuses available as certain points are passed. For example, along the fame track, you get to upgrade a building type at the 5 space and gain 2 karma at the 24 space. The money track alternates between granting players a single movement along the river and granting them 2 dice of their choice. Once passed by the money token, the cardboard disk placed on the 12 space will immediately move and be flipped to 33 space. In a worker placement game, having more workers allows you to perform more actions. Everyone starts the game with 3 workers and has the opportunity to gain 2 additional workers. Workers are available once the fame marker passes the 15 space, the money marker passes the 20 space, or the boat passes the bridge. The workers are available immediately. Once a player has obtained 2 additional workers from the board, the 3rd is removed from the game. Game end is triggered when the fame and money markers of a player meet or pass each other. The full round is not completed. However, each player, until the current start player, will be able to take one more action if they have the meeples available to do so. Once all moves have been taken, count the number of fame points between the money and fame markers for each player. The player with the highest number wins. In the case of a tie, the winner is the first person whose tokens crossed paths. That’s a wrap! You now know how play Rajas of the Ganges. May the best Raja win!\""

            "hi everyone my name is modi and i'm naveen from before you play and today we are going to be doing a playthrough of rogers of the ganges now this is a game that was requested by one of our longtime patreon supporters an executive producer so thank you so much for that this one's designed by two different designers inca and marcus brand and it is published by r r games and hooch and it is a two to four player very euro style game and so we are pretty excited to showcase it today it's interesting\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "it today it's interesting because it is definitely a heroes style game but there is some dice rolling there is yup there's quite a bit of dice rolling and so in this game we're going to be building up our province uh in india we're trying to earn a lot of money and fame at the same time and as per usual we are going to start with an overview of how the game is played then we're going to go into our playthrough and then our review of it and so if you're interested in jumping around we will\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "in jumping around we will include time stamps down below last but not least if you'd like to see more videos like this in the future please consider subscribing and with that we are ready to begin so if you please direct your attention to the center of the table we're all set up here for our two-player game of rogers of the ganges now we are playing with the two player side of the board the the board is reversible to scale for player count we each also have our own province boards now in this\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "province boards now in this game the primary mechanism here is we're going to be taking these tiles and we're going to be laying them out onto our province board to build out our estate and so the whole purpose of that is so that we can earn money and fame because the whole premise of this game is it is kind of like a dual-sided uh score track along the edge of the the board over here is the money track and so there is no physical money in this game whenever we spend and earn money we just\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "spend and earn money we just progress our marker along this track on the opposite side of the board starts the fame track and that is kind of like this golden fan side here and so over the course of the game whenever we earn fame we're going to progress along this track and so as soon as one person's markers kind of intersect and converge that is going to signal the end of the game you're going to finish out that turn and then at that point whoever's marker is intersected the furthest is the\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "the furthest is the winner yeah you want a delicate balance between money and fame in this game yeah so you heard that right there are no technical points in this game it's just whoever can get those markers to intersect past each other will win the game at the start of the game each player starts with one of each color of dice and there are four different colors of dice anytime you acquire dyson in the game you roll it immediately and then you place it on your kali statue and so we're going to\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "statue and so we're going to be playing the the standard uh mode of play because there's technically two different modes and so with this motor player we use this side of the province board as well as this side of the cauli statue so you can only hold a maximum of 10 dice and each player also starts with three workers the way that a round works is players are going to be taking turns placing their workers out onto the board because it's technically a work replacement game and so once everybody\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "game and so once everybody has placed on all of their workers then the round will end and you pretty much continue doing this until the end game has been met the board is divided into different sections and each section can do a specific thing and so there's the quarry over here the market the harbor which pertains to this river and then the palace and so let's just start with the quarry to discuss uh you know the different things that you can do each section has different work replacement\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "different work replacement spots and only one person's workers can go there at any given time and so some spots don't require you to pay anything and they'll be empty just like this some spots require you to turn in specific colors of dice or specific values of dice and some spots require you to pay money and so starting with a quarry over here this section allows you to build province tiles onto your province board you have to pay a little bit of money so the first person to go there has to\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "person to go there has to pay one money and you would just spend it on your money track here if you do this several times in a round then it kind of increases in the amount of money you have to pay but basically if i want to take this action i would place a worker there spend my money and then i get to place one of these tiles onto my profits board now the way that you read a tile here is as you can see each tile has a certain color at the top left-hand corner with a value and then it'll either\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "a value and then it'll either show a certain combination of markets that give you money or temples just like this one that give you fame and there are four different temples in the game which we'll talk about in a second but in order to uh purchase one of these tiles you have to spend dice from your cauli statue that add up to at least that value so if i were to take this tile i would have to spend blue dice that add up to at least a five i can overpay you just don't get changed and so i would\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "get changed and so i would turn in those dice into the supply and i would place this tile onto my profits board and so the rules are you must be able to connect your tile directly back to your own palace so i wouldn't be able to just place it out into the center here because i have to be able to connect you can have your roads get cut off as long as you can continually draw a path back to your main palace some other things that you might see on the board are some of these special bonuses along\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "these special bonuses along the edge if you can ever connect your path so that it connects to one of these special yields then you get that bonus immediately and so some things that you might see are like additional money so that would get me three money or a die from the supply of whatever color of your choosing you would just roll it right away put it under cauli statue sometimes you'll get fame and if you can ever connect to this middle area here there's also a space that gets you an upgrade\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "that gets you an upgrade for one of these temples which we'll talk about and so after you place your tile you also get the benefits of the tile itself and so if you have markets that give you money then you get that much money immediately on your score track if you place a tile that has a temple on it then you get as much fame as wherever your cube is on that specific temple and so this tile shows two different temples it shows this one and this one and so if i were to place this tile on my\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "were to place this tile on my board i would get two fame for this one because that's where my my cube is and two fame for this for a total of four fame now some bonuses throughout the game will allow you to do an upgrade which is kind of like that symbol that shows like a sideways arrow you'll see it right there as well and so anytime you see that bonus you get to choose one of these temples to move your marker up a space essentially increasing the value of that temple for any future placements\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "for any future placements of those tiles exactly yeah and so that is where a majority of the game is going to be taking place everything else that we're going to explain is just kind of how you can do that better right because you you need a steady flow of dice you know that is one of your main currencies in this game as you'll see the next section of the board is the markets and so the markets allow you to uh collect income for markets you've already placed on the board temples once you've\n",

            "\n",
            "the board temples once you've placed donuts they essentially don't do anything more for you they're one time only but markets you can continue to reap the benefits of throughout the game let's start with this spot over here because it's free as you can see if i were to place my worker here i can collect money from one of each type of market that i have on my board exactly there are three different types of markets in the game there is spice oops spice silk and tea if i were to go here i can\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "if i were to go here i can basically just um take the income of the highest value of one of each type of market that's on my board these spots here allow you to take income for only one specific type of market so if i were to go to this spot over here i would first of all have to turn in a die and then i would get to collect the income of all of the markets that have tea on it up to the value of the die right so if i were to discard this four and say i had five different tea markets on my board\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "tea markets on my board then i can reap the benefits of four of them basically the highest valued market exactly and the same holds true for these other two spaces it's just that you would uh collect income from silk and spice the next section is the harbor which is this area here the first person to go there doesn't have to pay anything and then the other ones cost money and so when you go to the harbor you're going to be moving your boat up the river and the river just gets you bonuses and\n",

            "\n",
            "just gets you bonuses and it's whatever the spot says on the board some bonuses will get you diced from the supply some will get you karma which we'll talk about in a second some money so it just really just depends on where you land on the river when you go to the harbor you have to give up a die a value one two or three and depending on the die value you could move up the number of spaces equal to that value so if i were to give up a three i can move up to three spaces now the way that the\n",

            "\n",
            "here um if you were to cross this spot on the money track then you get a worker or this spot on the fame track if ever you get your fifth worker then your six worker discus just gets taken out of the game because in the standard game you can only have a max of five and then last but not least we have the palace and the palaces is kind of this whole structure over here this whole bottom portion over here is just a way for you to gain additional dice so if i were to go to this spot i would take a\n",

            "\n",
            "to this spot i would take a purple dye from the supply and roll it if i were to go to this spot this is the only spot that's that gains you two money and allows you to re-roll any number of dice that you have on your kali statue these spots here allow you to turn in a specific color die for two dice of a different color so this is turning in an orange for two purple dice from the supply and then these spots here give you a benefit depending on the value of die that you've given up the pip value\n",

            "you've given up the pip value the pip value just really briefly this spot up here requires you to spend a one and that'll get you the first player marker as well as two fame if nobody takes this spot the first player marker will rotate but if you really want to be first next round you can go there the next the dancer over here requires a pip value of two and this will get you any two dice from the supply as well as a white yield token and so you would just take one of these tokens flip it over\n",

            "\n",
            "of these tokens flip it over and gain the bonus this person over here is a value of three this gets you a die from the supply of your choice as well as two karma and so karma we haven't talked about yet but uh this is the karma path over here everybody starts with one karma you can have a maximum of three and so karma what it what it does essentially is you pay one karma and you can take any dice that's in your cauli statue and flip it to its exact opposite side so that one i can convert into a\n",

            "that one i can convert into a six um you can never go beyond three karma so if i was here and i was to earn more karma it would just kind of lose out or cap out at that and that's essentially how karma works so that's a little bit more dice mitigation yes that is that is one of the main ways that you can mitigate your diet values this next one here requires a fit value of four that gets you a temple upgrade as well as three money this one over here is the master builder and this is the spot\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "6 to a 10 you would have to give up at least four pip value of that specific color and also the roads still have to make sense and get back to the temple yes your palace yes always and the final uh person at the palace gets you a six buck up on the river exactly six spaces it's not up to it's exactly six so if you are within six spaces at the very end here you cannot take that uh that person's action and i believe that's pretty much yeah the only the last thing that you really need to know are\n",

            "\n",
            "to clearly go up the fame track so it can get slightly a little bit like you're doing the same thing over and over but there is an expansion that we just got recently that we have not explored yet which i'm very very excited to play but overall i really really enjoy this game it is a very fun puzzle um how about you what do you think yeah so the first time we ever played this game or the first time i've ever heard about it was at a local convention a few years ago there's this thing the way\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "there's this thing the way that the convention works is you can sign up for just like a 101 if you don't want to play the game you just want to learn it and so those are just sessions where they just teach you how to play the game and so naveen i think you sat in i said in one and then i was playing a game downstairs and i just remember you running downstairs saying oh my gosh there is this game where the way that you win is by intersecting two scoring conditions and i thought wow that is\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "and i thought wow that is unique i haven't heard of a game because i don't know that yeah right so that was kind of what initially uh got us onto this game because we don't typically play games with a lot of dice but the way that this game does dice or handles dices really well it's more of a resource than anything yeah you there's a lot of different ways for you to gain different combinations of dice the main point of it is placing tiles on your board so yeah i really enjoy this game i i know\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "enjoy this game i i know what you mean it can become i don't i don't know if i want to call it sami but you know the whole purpose of the game is just getting dice you're just exchanging dice in a lot of different ways and placing tiles on your board and so that over and over again i guess can potentially get kind of kind of stale but like you said it's really nice to take a break from it and then come back to it and love it just like the first day you played it exactly yeah yeah i think the\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "exactly yeah yeah i think the reason why i say that is because those market tiles it's like well there's these three types of markets on there um and and you're obviously going to try to connect your roads um and so the bonuses on the standard side of the board are clearly okay i want to get to that early five five money i want to get to that three fame and i want to work down towards that bottom center tile uh the combination of how you do it and the way your dice roll and utilizing karma do\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "roll and utilizing karma do make it interesting but um whenever you have a good income source you're probably going to always go to that spot and try to tap that income the in the market yeah exactly the popular spot and so that's the only part that for me that aspect of it gets kind of samey but uh overall though you get to do a lot of cool things in the course of the game and so that's exactly why i like to take a break from the game come back and come back now granted we show or today we\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "granted we show or today we played the standard version of the game this is like the base version there are two main modes of play there's like uh the advanced side of the board that you flip over and you can kind of customize the special yields you get and so the dancer who is the spot number two in the palace yeah that gets you a bonus yield just you flip it and you get the thing that's different in the advanced game and so that might solve a lot of those kinds of things that you're\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "kinds of things that you're mentioning yeah that particular dancer in uh in the standard game which is what we played seems pretty overpowered uh because a a two value dice is not the most you know lucrative one like yeah you can go to the river and do something there or you can go to the dancer but you're basically exchanging one dice for two plus a bonus and we noticed the last couple times we played that that that seems to be like a very highly abused spot uh if i'm first player and i see\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "if i'm first player and i see that and i don't have really much going on in the market i'm definitely going to go and do that right yeah so it's a little bit different uh in the advanced version of the game you go to that spot it gets you a bonus that you can now place onto your board for you to achieve later on you don't get the wordpress immediately yeah so that that's kind of interesting how you can customize it but honestly the main reason why we play the standard version of the game is\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "version of the game is because that is a game that is this the version of the game that we enjoy that we enjoyed first yeah i guess and because it's probably easier for you to kind of understand the flow of the game uh with using that side otherwise like the video is mentioning this game does actually have a few mini expansions we haven't played with any of them yeah but it even came it even comes in its own like little goodie box that you yeah so there was like the mango and i think snake\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "the mango and i think snake expansion so there were like these mini expansions and they recently i remember recently maybe in the past year yeah year and a half came out with a goodie box that kind of encompasses all the expansions and i think a little bit more content yeah we still have it in shrink so uh now that we've played this a couple times leading up to this we gotta i'm excited to unbox that pretty much today yeah we really got to play with those because i think that the one thing is\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "i think that the one thing is those those tiles get uh are there's more tiles now so it gets a little more variety exactly that's cool yeah yeah what about the theme you know it's taken us this long to talk about it but this board game is set in india it is yeah what are your thoughts on that uh well it's it's not very thematic in terms of you know what's going on it's a true euro um the art style is very nice it is very thematic in that sense uh that indian style beautiful it's a little bit\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "beautiful it's a little bit busy it is a little bit busy it's uh beautiful yeah definitely when the board was first introduced me at that convention that you're talking about i was like what the heck is going on a little culture shock but uh yeah once you understand the flow of the game it's actually very very simple and you understand the layout of everything it makes total sense in terms of theme it's nice always to see an indian theme because i'm indian of course but it's not a very thematic\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "but it's not a very thematic game you're not doing too much in terms of theme but it does set a nice background background or backdrop for the game so you enjoy it i do yeah that's nice yeah i like it too i think it's beautiful it is very beautiful yes it the board skills well for player account we played on the the two player side of the board on the opposite side is for three and four just because of some of the spaces there's a little bit more space right and so in terms of player count how\n",

            "\n",
            "in terms of player count how do you feel uh plays well at all player counts yeah we played at all players we have played at all player accounts uh where is my favorite maybe three i want to say maybe uh it plays very well at two though it's nice to be able to go you know back to back i will say that when higher player counts there's the same amount of tiles out there and so everybody starts with the same opportunity with dice so something that you're eyeing could definitely get snatched up a\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "definitely get snatched up a lot faster in a higher player account so you just really have to keep an eye on people's dice yes is what that means exactly that's it becomes a part of your strategy yeah so there's a little more tension i think at a higher player account not that this is not intense i still felt that uh but yeah i think definitely three or four is the sweeter spot but very enjoyable for the amount of time that this game takes yes yeah it's fast at two it is fast we've recently\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "two it is fast we've recently played a four-player game of this so there was a lot of tension i actually think that i prefer the prefer the four player game just because of how tight everything is and just that added stress it's uh it's a nice kind of stress in this game especially because uh you increase your likelihood of several people crossing the finish line at the same time and then now you're like really counting like who crossed it further yeah right there's also i also feel like i\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "also i also feel like i guess going into the mechanics um there is a prevalent strategy i think there is and that kind of maybe that speaks to how you feel like it's uh you always want to kind of take a break from it because of that you know in the beginning i find that you need to get money so you're typically going to go for the tiles that provide markets and you're going to try to spam the market because that is one of the easier ways for you to gain your your fourth worker yes that's\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "your fourth worker yes that's exactly because who wants to go all the way up that river and that's typically how i feel like it works well because you also need to pay money for a lot of these action spots now granted the last game that we played in that four player game the person who won clearly was neither of us no he did not do that strategy he was doing a little bit of a mix so maybe i'm wrong yes but it does feel like that is kind of what you are going to be doing over and over again when\n",

            "over and over again when you come back to it in general i think the gameplay is really fun you're really looking for those combos you never want to run out of dice you also don't want to run out of karma right because it's really annoying to now like roll something really terrible and not be able to do anything about it yeah when you know that those tools are there yeah so the biggest thing for me is always trying to make sure that i have dice yes so whether it be getting those bonus spots that\n",

            "those bonus spots that get you an extra die when you use your last one or hitting that token yeah or getting your special yields in order to just like passively acquire dice that's kind of a big deal in this game yeah because i don't think in our playthrough we went to the spot where you just put a worker down get a dice and you have these four yeah no that is uh that is a rough spot to go to yeah yeah it does feel good it is yeah anyway that is how we feel about rogers with the ganges what is\n",
